Our customers use our printers in a wide range of applications, including routing and tracking, patient\nsafety, transaction processing, personal identification, and product authentication. These applications require high levels of data\naccuracy, speed, and reliability. They also include specialty printing for receipts and tickets for improved customer service and\nproductivity gains.\nOur printers use thermal printing technology, which creates images by heating certain pixels of an electrical printhead to selectively\nimage a ribbon or heat-sensitive substrate. Our printers integrate company-designed mechanisms, electrical systems, and firmware that\nsupports serial, parallel, Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth, or 802.11 wireless communications with appropriate security protocols. Enclosures\nof metal or high-impact plastic help ensure durability of our printers. Printing instructions can be received as a proprietary language\nsuch as Zebra Programming Language II, as a print driver-provided image, or as user-defined Extensible Markup Language. These\nfeatures make our printers easy to integrate into most computer systems.\nWe also provide dye-sublimination thermal card printers that produce high quality images and are used for secure, reliable personal\nidentification (e.g. state identification cards, drivers’ licenses, and healthcare identification cards), access control (e.g. employee or\nstudent building access), and financial transactions (e.g. credit, debit and ATM cards). Additionally, we provide RFID printers that\nencode data into passive RFID transponders embedded in a label or card. We offer a wide range of accessories and options for our\nprinters, including carrying cases, vehicle mounts and battery chargers.\nSupplies: We produce and sell stock and customized thermal labels, receipts, ribbons, plastic cards, and RFID tags suitable for use with\nour printers, as well as wristbands for use in laser printers. We support our printing products, resellers, and end-users with an extensive\nline of superior quality, high-performance supplies optimized to a particular end-user’s needs, such as chemical or abrasion resistance,\nextreme temperature environments, exceptional image quality, or long life. We promote the use of supplies with our printing\nequipment. Our supplies business also includes temperature-monitoring labels primarily used in vaccine distribution, which incorporate\nchemical indicators designed to change color upon exceeding predefined time and/or temperature thresholds.\nServices: We provide a full range of maintenance, technical support, and repair services. We also provide managed and professional\nservices, including those which help customers manage their devices and related software applications. Our offerings include cloud-\nbased subscriptions and multiple service levels. They are typically contracted through multi-year service agreements. We provide our\nservices directly and through our global network of partners.\nEnterprise Visibility & Mobility\nMobile Computing: We design, manufacture, and sell rugged and enterprise-grade mobile computing products and accessories in a\nvariety of specialized form factors and designs to meet a wide array of enterprise applications. Purpose-built devices ensure reliable\noperations for targeted use cases, surviving years of rough handling and harsh environments. Industrial applications include inventory\nmanagement in warehouses and distribution centers; field mobility applications include field service, post and parcel, and direct store\ndelivery; and retail and customer facing applications include e-commerce, omnichannel, mobile point of sale, inventory look-up, staff\ncollaboration, and analytics. Our mobile computing products primarily incorporate the Android™ operating system and support local-\narea and wide-area voice and data communications. Our products are also offered with software tools and services that enable secure\ndata transmission while also supporting application development, device configuration, and field support to facilitate seamless, rapid\ndeployment and maximum customer return on investment. Our products often incorporate barcode scanning, global position system\nand RFID features, and other sensory capabilities. Additionally, specialized features, such as advanced data capture technologies, data\nanalytics technologies, voice and video collaboration tools, and advanced battery technologies, enable our customers to work more\nefficiently and better serve their own customers.\nData Capture, RFID, Fixed Industrial Scanning, and Machine Vision: We design, manufacture, and sell barcode scanners, RFID\nreaders, industrial machine vision cameras, and fixed industrial scanners.
