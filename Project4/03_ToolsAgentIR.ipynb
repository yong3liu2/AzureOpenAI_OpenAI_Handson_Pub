Our customers use our printers in a wide range of applications, including routing and tracking, patient\\nsafety, transaction processing, personal identification, and product authentication. These applications require high levels of data\\naccuracy, speed, and reliability. They also include specialty printing for receipts and tickets for improved customer service and\\nproductivity gains.\\nOur printers use thermal printing technology, which creates images by heating certain pixels of an electrical printhead to selectively\\nimage a ribbon or heat-sensitive substrate. Our printers integrate company-designed mechanisms, electrical systems, and firmware that\\nsupports serial, parallel, Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth, or 802.11 wireless communications with appropriate security protocols. Enclosures\\nof metal or high-impact plastic help ensure durability of our printers. Printing instructions can be received as a proprietary language\\nsuch as Zebra Programming Language II, as a print driver-provided image, or as user-defined Extensible Markup Language. These\\nfeatures make our printers easy to integrate into most computer systems.\\nWe also provide dye-sublimination thermal card printers that produce high quality images and are used for secure, reliable personal\\nidentification (e.g. state identification cards, drivers’ licenses, and healthcare identification cards), access control (e.g. employee or\\nstudent building access), and financial transactions (e.g. credit, debit and ATM cards). Additionally, we provide RFID printers that\\nencode data into passive RFID transponders embedded in a label or card. We offer a wide range of accessories and options for our\\nprinters, including carrying cases, vehicle mounts and battery chargers.\\nSupplies: We produce and sell stock and customized thermal labels, receipts, ribbons, plastic cards, and RFID tags suitable for use with\\nour printers, as well as wristbands for use in laser printers. We support our printing products, resellers, and end-users with an extensive\\nline of superior quality, high-performance supplies optimized to a particular end-user’s needs, such as chemical or abrasion resistance,\\nextreme temperature environments, exceptional image quality, or long life. We promote the use of supplies with our printing\\nequipment. Our supplies business also includes temperature-monitoring labels primarily used in vaccine distribution, which incorporate\\nchemical indicators designed to change color upon exceeding predefined time and/or temperature thresholds.\\nServices: We provide a full range of maintenance, technical support, and repair services. We also provide managed and professional\\nservices, including those which help customers manage their devices and related software applications. Our offerings include cloud-\\nbased subscriptions and multiple service levels. They are typically contracted through multi-year service agreements. We provide our\\nservices directly and through our global network of partners.\\nEnterprise Visibility & Mobility\\nMobile Computing: We design, manufacture, and sell rugged and enterprise-grade mobile computing products and accessories in a\\nvariety of specialized form factors and designs to meet a wide array of enterprise applications. Purpose-built devices ensure reliable\\noperations for targeted use cases, surviving years of rough handling and harsh environments. Industrial applications include inventory\\nmanagement in warehouses and distribution centers; field mobility applications include field service, post and parcel, and direct store\\ndelivery; and retail and customer facing applications include e-commerce, omnichannel, mobile point of sale, inventory look-up, staff\\ncollaboration, and analytics. Our mobile computing products primarily incorporate the Android™ operating system and support local-\\narea and wide-area voice and data communications.

They also include specialty printing for receipts and tickets for improved customer service and\\nproductivity gains.\\nOur printers use thermal printing technology, which creates images by heating certain pixels of an electrical printhead to selectively\\nimage a ribbon or heat-sensitive substrate. Our printers integrate company-designed mechanisms, electrical systems, and firmware that\\nsupports serial, parallel, Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth, or 802.11 wireless communications with appropriate security protocols. Enclosures\\nof metal or high-impact plastic help ensure durability of our printers. Printing instructions can be received as a proprietary language\\nsuch as Zebra Programming Language II, as a print driver-provided image, or as user-defined Extensible Markup Language. These\\nfeatures make our printers easy to integrate into most computer systems.\\nWe also provide dye-sublimination thermal card printers that produce high quality images and are used for secure, reliable personal\\nidentification (e.g. state identification cards, drivers’ licenses, and healthcare identification cards), access control (e.g. employee or\\nstudent building access), and financial transactions (e.g. credit, debit and ATM cards). Additionally, we provide RFID printers that\\nencode data into passive RFID transponders embedded in a label or card. We offer a wide range of accessories and options for our\\nprinters, including carrying cases, vehicle mounts and battery chargers.\\nSupplies: We produce and sell stock and customized thermal labels, receipts, ribbons, plastic cards, and RFID tags suitable for use with\\nour printers, as well as wristbands for use in laser printers. We support our printing products, resellers, and end-users with an extensive\\nline of superior quality, high-performance supplies optimized to a particular end-user’s needs, such as chemical or abrasion resistance,\\nextreme temperature environments, exceptional image quality, or long life.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\\nfinancial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),\\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our\\nreport dated February 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error\\nor fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\\nfinancial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),\\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our\\nreport dated February 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error\\nor fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were\\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to\\nthe financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

We have reported our results reflecting this change, including historical\\nperiods, on a comparable basis. This change does not have an impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 20, Segment\\nInformation & Geographic Data for additional information related to each segment’s results.\\nNote 2 Significant Accounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThese accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\\nthe U.S. and include the accounts of Zebra and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions\\nhave been eliminated in consolidation.\\nFiscal Calendar\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is a 52-week period ending on December 31. Interim fiscal quarters end on a Saturday and generally include\\n13 weeks of operating activity. During the 2022 fiscal year, the Company’s quarter end dates were April 2, July 2, October 1, and\\nDecember 31.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThese consolidated financial statements were prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported\\namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Examples of accounting estimates include: cash flow projections and\\nother valuation assumptions included in business acquisition purchase price allocations as well as annual goodwill impairment testing;\\nthe measurement of variable consideration and allocation of transaction price to performance obligations in revenue transactions;\\ninventory valuation; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and\\nliabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be\\nreasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nCash consists primarily of deposits with banks. In addition, the Company considers highly liquid short-duration term deposits with\\nbanks, as well as other highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of less than three months, to be cash equivalents.\\nCash equivalents are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of\\na change in value because of changes in interest rates.\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nAccounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our customers in the normal course of business. Collateral on trade\\naccounts receivable is generally not required. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible\\naccounts receivable that is based on expected credit losses. Expected credit losses are estimated based on historical loss experience, the\\ndurations of outstanding trade receivables, and expectations of the future economic environment. Accounts are written off against the\\nallowance account when they are determined to be no longer collectible.', metadata={'source': 'data_source/10-K\\\\zbra-20221231_10-K.pdf', 'page': 69}), Document(page_content=\"11/25/23, 7:00 PM zbra-20221231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/877212/000087721223000025/zbra-20221231.htm 63/132Table of Contents\\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\\n(In millions, except share data)\\n \\nDecember 31,\\n2022 2021\\nAssets\\nCurrent assets:\\nCash and cash equivalents $ 105 $ 332 \\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $1 million each as of\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 768 752 \\nInventories, net 860 491 \\nIncome tax receivable 26 8 \\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 124 106 \\nTotal Current assets 1,883 1,689 \\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 278 272 \\nRight-of-use lease assets 156 131 \\nGoodwill 3,899 3,265 \\nOther intangibles, net 630 469 \\nDeferred income taxes 407 192 \\nOther long-term assets 276 197 \\nTotal Assets $ 7,529 $ 6,215 \\nLiabilities and Stockholders' Equity\\nCurrent liabilities:\\nCurrent portion of long-term debt $ 214 $ 69 \\nAccounts payable 811 700 \\nAccrued liabilities 744 639 \\nDeferred revenue 425 380 \\nIncome taxes payable 138 12 \\nTotal Current liabilities 2,332 1,800 \\nLong-term debt 1,809 922 \\nLong-term lease liabilities 139 121 \\nDeferred income taxes 75 6 \\nLong-term deferred revenue 333 315 \\nOther long-term liabilities 108 67 \\nTotal Liabilities 4,796 3,231 \\nStockholders’ Equity:\\nPreferred stock, $.01 par value; authorized 10,000,000 shares; none issued — — \\nClass A common stock, $.01 par value; authorized 150,000,000 shares; issued 72,151,857\\nshares 1 1 \\nAdditional paid-in capital 561 462 \\nTreasury stock at cost, 20,700,357 and 18,736,582 shares as of December 31, 2022 and\\n2021, respectively (1,799) (1,023)\\nRetained earnings 4,036 3,573 \\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (66) (29)\\nTotal Stockholders’ Equity 2,733 2,984 \\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity $ 7,529 $ 6,215 \\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n41\", metadata={'source': './data_source/zbra-20221231_10-K.pdf', 'page': 62}), Document(page_content=\"11/25/23, 7:00 PM zbra-20221231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/877212/000087721223000025/zbra-20221231.htm 63/132Table of Contents\\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\\n(In millions, except share data)\\n \\nDecember 31,\\n2022 2021\\nAssets\\nCurrent assets:\\nCash and cash equivalents $ 105 $ 332 \\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $1 million each as of\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 768 752 \\nInventories, net 860 491 \\nIncome tax receivable 26 8 \\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 124 106 \\nTotal Current assets 1,883 1,689 \\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 278 272 \\nRight-of-use lease assets 156 131 \\nGoodwill 3,899 3,265 \\nOther intangibles, net 630 469 \\nDeferred income taxes 407 192 \\nOther long-term assets 276 197 \\nTotal Assets $ 7,529 $ 6,215 \\nLiabilities and Stockholders' Equity\\nCurrent liabilities:\\nCurrent portion of long-term debt $ 214 $ 69 \\nAccounts payable 811 700 \\nAccrued liabilities 744 639 \\nDeferred revenue 425 380 \\nIncome taxes payable 138 12 \\nTotal Current liabilities 2,332 1,800 \\nLong-term debt 1,809 922 \\nLong-term lease liabilities 139 121 \\nDeferred income taxes 75 6 \\nLong-term deferred revenue 333 315 \\nOther long-term liabilities 108 67 \\nTotal Liabilities 4,796 3,231 \\nStockholders’ Equity:\\nPreferred stock, $.01 par value; authorized 10,000,000 shares; none issued — — \\nClass A common stock, $.01 par value; authorized 150,000,000 shares; issued 72,151,857\\nshares 1 1 \\nAdditional paid-in capital 561 462 \\nTreasury stock at cost, 20,700,357 and 18,736,582 shares as of December 31, 2022 and\\n2021, respectively (1,799) (1,023)\\nRetained earnings 4,036 3,573 \\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (66) (29)\\nTotal Stockholders’ Equity 2,733 2,984 \\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity $ 7,529 $ 6,215 \\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n41\", metadata={'source': 'data_source/10-K\\\\zbra-20221231_10-K.pdf', 'page': 62})]\u001b[0m\n",

We design, manufacture, and\\nsell a broad range of products and solutions, including cloud-based software subscriptions, that capture and move data. We also provide\\na full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, repair, managed and professional services. End-users of our products,\\nsolutions and services include those in retail and e-commerce, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, healthcare, public sector, and\\nother industries. We provide our products, solutions and services globally through a direct sales force and an extensive network of\\nchannel partners.\\nEffective January 1, 2022, the location solutions offering, which provides a range of real-time location systems (“RTLS”) and services\\nthat generate on-demand information about the physical location and status of assets, equipment, and people, moved from our Asset\\nIntelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) segment into our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”) segment contemporaneous with a change\\nin our organizational structure and management of the business. We have reported our results reflecting this change, including historical\\nperiods, on a comparable basis. This change does not have an impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 20, Segment\\nInformation & Geographic Data for additional information related to each segment’s results.\\nNote 2 Significant Accounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThese accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\\nthe U.S. and include the accounts of Zebra and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions\\nhave been eliminated in consolidation.\\nFiscal Calendar\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is a 52-week period ending on December 31. Interim fiscal quarters end on a Saturday and generally include\\n13 weeks of operating activity. During the 2022 fiscal year, the Company’s quarter end dates were April 2, July 2, October 1, and\\nDecember 31.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThese consolidated financial statements were prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported\\namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Examples of accounting estimates include: cash flow projections and\\nother valuation assumptions included in business acquisition purchase price allocations as well as annual goodwill impairment testing;\\nthe measurement of variable consideration and allocation of transaction price to performance obligations in revenue transactions;\\ninventory valuation; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and\\nliabilities.

We provide our products, solutions and services globally through a direct sales force and an extensive network of\\nchannel partners.\\nEffective January 1, 2022, the location solutions offering, which provides a range of real-time location systems (“RTLS”) and services\\nthat generate on-demand information about the physical location and status of assets, equipment, and people, moved from our Asset\\nIntelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) segment into our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”) segment contemporaneous with a change\\nin our organizational structure and management of the business. We have reported our results reflecting this change, including historical\\nperiods, on a comparable basis. This change does not have an impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 20, Segment\\nInformation & Geographic Data for additional information related to each segment’s results.\\nNote 2 Significant Accounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThese accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\\nthe U.S. and include the accounts of Zebra and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions\\nhave been eliminated in consolidation.\\nFiscal Calendar\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is a 52-week period ending on December 31. Interim fiscal quarters end on a Saturday and generally include\\n13 weeks of operating activity. During the 2022 fiscal year, the Company’s quarter end dates were April 2, July 2, October 1, and\\nDecember 31.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThese consolidated financial statements were prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported\\namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Examples of accounting estimates include: cash flow projections and\\nother valuation assumptions included in business acquisition purchase price allocations as well as annual goodwill impairment testing;\\nthe measurement of variable consideration and allocation of transaction price to performance obligations in revenue transactions;\\ninventory valuation; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and\\nliabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be\\nreasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nCash consists primarily of deposits with banks. In addition, the Company considers highly liquid short-duration term deposits with\\nbanks, as well as other highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of less than three months, to be cash equivalents.\\nCash equivalents are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of\\na change in value because of changes in interest rates.\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nAccounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our customers in the normal course of business. Collateral on trade\\naccounts receivable is generally not required. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible\\naccounts receivable that is based on expected credit losses. Expected credit losses are estimated based on historical loss experience, the\\ndurations of outstanding trade receivables, and expectations of the future economic environment. Accounts are written off against the\\nallowance account when they are determined to be no longer collectible.', metadata={'source': 'data_source/10-K\\\\zbra-20221231_10-K.pdf', 'page': 69})]\u001b[0m\n",

Our customers use our printers in a wide range of applications, including routing and tracking, patient\\nsafety, transaction processing, personal identification, and product authentication. These applications require high levels of data\\naccuracy, speed, and reliability. They also include specialty printing for receipts and tickets for improved customer service and\\nproductivity gains.\\nOur printers use thermal printing technology, which creates images by heating certain pixels of an electrical printhead to selectively\\nimage a ribbon or heat-sensitive substrate. Our printers integrate company-designed mechanisms, electrical systems, and firmware that\\nsupports serial, parallel, Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth, or 802.11 wireless communications with appropriate security protocols. Enclosures\\nof metal or high-impact plastic help ensure durability of our printers. Printing instructions can be received as a proprietary language\\nsuch as Zebra Programming Language II, as a print driver-provided image, or as user-defined Extensible Markup Language.

Our exposures include the London Inter-bank Offered\\nRate (“LIBOR”) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). We use interest rate derivative contracts, including interest rate\\nswaps, to mitigate the majority of the Company’s exposure from interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances,\\nthereby reducing the volatility of our financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired\\nproportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt. Generally, under these interest rate swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange\\nfloating-rate for fixed-rate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional amount.\\nThe United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced in 2017 the phase out of LIBOR. We continue\\nto closely monitor the phase out of LIBOR to assess any impacts to our debt and interest rate swap contracts. We have already taken\\nactions to amend certain contracts to incorporate a SOFR benchmark rate, and we expect other key contracts will be amended to\\nincorporate a SOFR benchmark rate before the LIBOR phase out is completed. As of December 31, 2022, our remaining contracts\\ncontaining exposure to LIBOR pertain only to LIBOR tenors that will be phased out by June 30, 2023.\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2.0 billion of debt outstanding under our debt facilities, which bears interest\\ndetermined by reference to a variable rate index. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or\\ndecrease annual interest expense by approximately $12 million. This exposure includes the impact of associated forward interest rate\\nswaps outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 11, Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements for further discussion of these risk mitigation activities. Exposure to variable interest may increase or decrease, to the extent\\nthat the Company’s borrowings under its debt facilities increase or decrease, respectively.\\nForeign Exchange Risk\\nWe provide products, solutions and services in approximately 190 countries throughout the world and, therefore, at times are exposed\\nto risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates. In some instances, we invoice customers in their local currency and have a\\nresulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable. We also purchase certain raw materials and other\\nitems in foreign currencies. We manage these risks using derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency exchange\\ncontracts. See Note 11, Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of hedging\\nactivities.\\nThe currencies that we are primarily exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are the Euro, British Pound Sterling,\\nand Czech Koruna. A one percentage point increase or decrease in exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar would increase or decrease\\nour pre-tax income by approximately $2 million.

Discussions of\\n2020 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included herein.

The AIDC market consists of mobile computing, data capture, radio frequency identification devices\\n(“RFID”), barcode printing, and other workflow automation products and services. The Company’s operations consist of two reportable\\nsegments that provide complementary offerings to our customers: Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) and Enterprise Visibility &\\nMobility (“EVM”). Refer to Part I, Item 1 of this document for additional information.\\n•The AIT segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies. Its major product lines include\\nbarcode and card printers, supplies, including temperature-monitoring labels and services.\\n•The EVM segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture solutions. Its major product lines include\\nmobile computing, data capture, RFID, fixed industrial scanning and machine vision, services, workflow optimization\\nsolutions and location solutions. Our workflow optimization solutions include cloud-based software subscriptions, retail\\nsolutions, and robotic automation solutions.\\nDuring the past year, we have maintained our position as a market leader in our core businesses, which are generally considered to be\\ncomprised of our mobile computing and data capture products, printing products and supplies, as well as support and repair services.\\nCustomers across the industries that we serve have benefited from our core offerings to keep pace with the increasingly on-demand\\neconomy and to invest in their long-term technology capabilities.\\nThe Company has continued to make strategic investments to accelerate progress in certain adjacent and expansion markets. In June\\n2022, the Company acquired Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd. (“Matrox) for $881 million in cash, net of Matrox’s cash on-hand.\\nMatrox, part of our EVM segment, is a leading provider of advanced machine vision components and software serving many end-\\nmarkets. Through its acquisition of Matrox, the Company significantly expanded its machine vision products and software offerings.\\nThe Company also continues to focus on scaling and integrating our other recent acquisitions (Antuit.ai, Fetch Robotics, Adaptive\\nVision Sp. z.o.o., and Reflexis) providing growth opportunities across our software and robotic solution offerings. These investments\\nwere funded partly through cash flow generation from our core businesses operations as well as through borrowings and other working\\ncapital facilities that enable us to maintain strong liquidity and manageable debt leverage.\\nAs part of our ongoing supply chain optimization and resiliency initiatives, we extended the transition timeline of our distribution\\ncenter in North America. The transition negatively impacted product fulfillment and operating results in the third quarter and\\ncontributed to elevated inventory levels. To mitigate the impacts associated with that transition, we resumed servicing customer orders\\nthrough our existing logistics service provider. Additionally, in January 2023, we terminated our contractual arrangement with the new\\nservice provider and have directly assumed the distribution center lease and have staffed the facility with Zebra employees, hence\\nassuming all operational activities at the location.\\nWe are actively managing our inventory levels and have been addressing certain component part shortages through a combination of\\nentering long-term supply commitments with key vendors, utilizing expedited modes of transportation, as well as executing select\\nproduct re-designs. We anticipate inventory levels to remain elevated from historical levels as we continue to manage through supply\\nchain challenges.\\nMacroeconomic Environment\\nThe acceleration of broad global cost inflation, a rising interest rate environment, and a stronger U.S. dollar in the current year have\\nnegatively impacted our operating results. We have partially mitigated the financial impacts of these headwinds through a combination\\nof targeted price increases, as well as our ongoing foreign currency exchange and interest rate risk management programs. We believe\\nthat this challenging operating environment, partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia/Ukraine war, has contributed to a\\ndeceleration of certain customer demand, particularly late in the current year.
