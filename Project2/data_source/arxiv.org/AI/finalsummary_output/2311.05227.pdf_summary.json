        "Summary": " C. Mougan, J. Brand. Kantian Deontology Meets AI Alignment: Towards Morally Robust Fairness Metrics. arXiv:2311.05227v1 [cs.AI] 9 Nov 2023 2 Deontology, on the other hand, is often seen as more concerned with the intrinsic value of individuals and the moral worth of actions themselves, rather than the overall consequences. This aligns with Kant's emphasis on individual conduct and the importance of following moral principles, rather than simply seeking the greatest good for the greatest number. In this paper, we argue for the incorporation of Kantian deontology into fairness metrics, specifically in the context of AI alignment. Fairness metrics are a crucial aspect of AI alignment, as they help to evaluate whether AI systems are treating individuals and groups fairly. However, the current dominant approach to fairness metrics is utilitarian, which prioritizes the overall good over individual rights and dignity. This can lead to the subordination of individuals for the sake of the greater good, which goes against the principles of deontological ethics. By integrating Kantian ethics into AI alignment, we not only bring in a widely-accepted prominent moral theory but also strive for a more morally grounded AI landscape that better balances outcomes and procedures in pursuit of fairness and justice. In the following sections, we will first provide a brief overview of Kant's ethical framework, focusing on the Formula of Humanity and the Formula of Autonomy. We will then contrast deontology with utilitarianism and highlight the importance of incorporating deontological principles into fairness metrics. Finally, we will provide an overview of current fairness metrics and discuss how they can be improved by incorporating Kantian deontology. 2 Kantian Deontology Kant's ethical framework is based on the idea that moral principles should be universal and applicable to all rational beings. He believed that moral actions should be guided by a sense of duty, rather than self-interest or personal desires. This sense of duty is derived from the categorical imperative, which is a fundamental principle that guides moral action. The categorical imperative has three formulations, the first of which is the Formula of Universal Law: \"Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law\" (Groundwork, 4:421). This formulation emphasizes the importance of consistency and universality in moral principles. The second formulation is the Formula of Humanity: \"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end and never merely as a means to an end\" (Groundwork, 4:429). This formulation is often interpreted as a prohibition against using others as mere instruments for our own purposes. It emphasizes the intrinsic value and dignity of each individual and requires us to treat others with respect and consideration. The third formulation, the Formula of Autonomy, states that we should act in accordance with the maxims of a member giving universal laws for a merely possible kingdom of ends (Groundwork, 4:439). This formulation highlights the idea of self-governance and the importance of individuals being able to make their own moral decisions. Overall, the categorical imperative serves as a fundamental standard for moral evaluation, emphasizing the intrinsic value of each individual and prohibiting their instrumental subordination for the greater good. 3 Deontology vs Utilitarianism In contrast to utilitarianism, which focuses on the consequences of actions, deontology emphasizes the moral worth of actions themselves. Deontological ethics are based on the idea that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. This aligns with the Kantian emphasis on individual conduct and the importance of following moral principles, rather than simply seeking the greatest good for the greatest number. Deontology also places a strong emphasis on individual rights and dignity, which is often overlooked in utilitarian approaches. Additionally, deontology recognizes the importance of considering the impact of actions on individuals and society as a whole, rather than solely focusing on the overall outcome. This is particularly relevant in the context of AI alignment, as AI systems can have significant impacts on individuals and society, and it is important to consider the ethical implications of these impacts. 4 Overview of Fairness Metrics Fairness metrics are a crucial aspect of AI alignment, as they help to evaluate whether AI systems are treating individuals and groups fairly. However, the current dominant approach to fairness metrics is utilitarian, which prioritizes the overall good over individual rights and dignity. This can lead to the subordination of individuals for the sake of the greater good, which goes against the principles of deontological ethics. The article argues for the incorporation of Kantian deontology into fairness metrics, specifically through the use of the categorical imperative, to promote a more ethically grounded and balanced approach to AI decision-making. It also critiques the utilitarian approach to evaluating actions and highlights the importance of considering the impact of AI systems on individuals and society as a whole. By incorporating deontological principles into fairness metrics, we can strive for a more morally robust and just AI landscape that respects the intrinsic value and dignity of each individual."
