        "Summary": "The study evaluated the performance of two versions of GPT-4V (Multimodal and Text Only) on 69 NEJM clinicopathological conferences and 936 NEJM Image Challenge cases. The results showed that Multimodal GPT-4V had a higher average score and higher accuracy in certain image types and skin types compared to human respondents in the NEJM Image Challenges. The study also included four example cases to demonstrate the reasoning abilities of GPT-4V in different scenarios. The study concludes that GPT-4V has potential in assisting with diagnoses in clinicopathological conferences, especially when combined with multimodal evaluation. The study also discusses potential challenges and limitations of using vision-language models in clinical settings, such as the risk of shortcut reasoning and the need for comprehensive studies before clinical use. The study suggests future research directions, including fine-tuning the baseline model and considering human use of such systems in the diagnostic process. The study also presents data on the performance of GPT-4V in relation to the length and informativeness of text descriptions, as well as its accuracy in different image types and skin colors. The study also compares the performance of GPT-4V to human respondents and highlights the potential of GPT-4V in improving diagnostic accuracy in medical settings. The study also provides information on the statistical analysis methods used and the ethical considerations of the study. The study also discusses the evaluation process and potential limitations, such as the risk of memorization of leaked cases and the sensitivity analysis performed. The study also presents data on the performance of GPT-4V in different scenarios, including cases with only text or image, and stratifies performance by question word count. The study also evaluates the performance of GPT-4V by image type and skin tone, using a prior set of annotations from the NEJM Image Challenge. The study also discusses the use of chain-of-thought prompting to elicit reasoning in case study examples. The primary outcome of the study was whether or not the final diagnosis appeared in the differential, with secondary outcomes including the correct diagnosis listed as the top diagnosis, the length and quality of the differential, and the use of GPT-4V in both NEJM clinicopathological conferences and Image Challenges. The study highlights the potential of GPT-4V in assisting with medical diagnoses and provides insights into its performance and limitations in different scenarios and populations."
