        "Summary": "The article discusses the \"Gimbal\" UAP encounter, which was recorded by a U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet's AN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR targeting pod in January 2015 off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida. The article presents a reconstruction of the encounter using a simulator developed by UAP investigator Mick West. The article also discusses an alternative hypothesis proposed by West, which suggests that the object's anomalous rotation is caused by the ATFLIR pod rotation and that the IR signature observed is an infrared \"glare\" from engine exhaust. The article includes figures and data to support the discussion, such as ground and air speed measurements and a potential flight path of the object. The article also discusses the lines of sight (LOS) and how they were estimated using the azimuth (Az) and elevation (El) angles indicated on the ATFLIR display. The article concludes by stating that the purpose of the discussion is to provide an overview of the investigations and encourage further investigation and interpretation from experts in aviation and military systems."
