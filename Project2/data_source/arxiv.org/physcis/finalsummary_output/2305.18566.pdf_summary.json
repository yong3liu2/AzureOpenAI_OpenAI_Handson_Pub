        "Summary": "The article discusses the need for a more inclusive and descriptive term for the study of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). The authors propose the term \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena\" (UAP) and discuss the history and current state of research on these phenomena. They highlight the lack of scientific attention and the potential for new technologies and approaches to advance our understanding of UAP. The article also outlines the instrumentation and techniques being used in the Galileo Project, a new initiative aimed at conducting a comprehensive aerial census and categorization of UAP. The importance of using a variety of instruments and techniques to accurately capture and analyze UAP data is emphasized, as well as the challenges and strategies for identifying and categorizing these anomalies. The potential implications of the extraterrestrial hypothesis in this field of research are also touched upon, along with the importance of considering all available data and using a rigorous approach in designing instrumentation for the study of UAP. The article also includes a list of authors and their affiliations, as well as information on the Open Access publication and distribution of the article. "
