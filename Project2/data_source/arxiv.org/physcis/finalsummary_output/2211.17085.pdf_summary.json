        "Summary": "This section provides a detailed analysis of Object 9252, which was detected during sky monitoring on August 24, 2018. The object's characteristics, including its distance, altitude, size, and speed, are described. The appendix includes figures showing the object's track and trajectory in pseudo colors, as well as a discussion of the technology used to detect the object. The section also discusses the object's angular velocity and color properties, with calculations and diagrams provided. The appendix also includes restored images of the object with different albedo values. The section concludes with a discussion of astronomical observations of bright flying objects, specifically unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), and their properties such as size, brightness, and variability. The section also discusses the use of parallax measurements and albedo values to determine the size of UAPs. The section also includes a discussion of the equipment and methods used for UAP observations, as well as the results of these observations. The Main Astronomical Observatory of NAS of Ukraine conducts an independent study of UAPs, using two meteor stations in Kyiv and Vinarivka. The section also discusses the two types of UAPs observed, Cosmics and Phantoms, and their high speeds and difficulty in detection. The results of previous UAP studies are also mentioned, including the detection of variable objects and their color characteristics. The section concludes with estimates of the size and speed of Phantoms observed in the troposphere."
