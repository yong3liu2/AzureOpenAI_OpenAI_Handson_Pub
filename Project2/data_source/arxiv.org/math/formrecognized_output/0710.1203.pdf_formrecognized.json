Techniques for data-mining, latent semantic analysis, contextual search of databases, etc. have long ago been developed by computer scientists working on information retrieval (IR). Experimental scientists, from all disciplines, having to analyse large collections of raw experimental data (astronomical, physical, biological, etc.) have developed powerful methods for their statistical analysis and for clustering, categorising, and classifying objects. Finally, physicists have developed a theory of quantum measurement, unifying the logical, algebraic, and probabilistic aspects of queries into a single formalism. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first to show that when formulated at an abstract level, problems from IR, from statistical data analysis, and from physical measurement the- ories are very similar and hence can profitably be cross-fertilised, and, secondly, to propose a novel method of fuzzy hierarchical clustering, termed semantic distillation - strongly in- spired from the theory of quantum measurement -, we developed to analyse raw data coming from various types of experiments on DNA arrays. We illustrate the method by analysing DNA arrays experiments and clustering the genes of the array according to their specificity. arXiv:0710.1203v2 [math.PR] 6 Oct 2007 Keywords: Quantum information retrieval, semantic distillation, DNA microarray, quan- tum and fuzzy logic 1 Introduction Sequencing the genome constituted a culminating point in the analytic approach of Biology. Now starts the era of the synthetic approach in Systems Biology where interactions among genes induce their differential expression that leads to the func- tional specificity of cells, the coherent organisation of cells into tissues, organs, and finally organisms. However, we are yet far from a complete explanatory theory of living matter. It is therefore important to establish precise and quantitative phenomenology before be- ing able to formulate a theory. The contribution of this paper is to provide the reader with a novel algorithmic method, termed semantic distillation, to analyse DNA ar- rays experiments (where genes are hybridised with various cell lines corresponding to various tissues or specific individuals) by determining the degree of specificity of"

The method provides experimental biologists with lists of candidate genes (ordered by their degree of specificity) for every bio- logical context, clinicians with improved tools for diagnosis, pharmacologists with patient-tailored therapies, etc. In the sequel we present the method split into several algorithmic tasks thought as subroutines of the general algorithm. It is worth noting that the method, although can profitably exploit, does not rely on any previous information stored in the existing databases; its rationale is to help analysing raw experimental data even in the absence of any previous knowledge. The main idea of the method is summarised as follows. Experimental information hold on the objects of the system undergoes a sequence of processing steps; each step is performed on a different representation of the information. Those different representation spaces and the corresponding information processing act as successive filters revealing at the end the most pertinent and significant part of the information, hence the name \"semantic distillation\". At the first stage, raw experimental data, containing all available information, are represented in an abstract Hilbert space, the space of concepts - reminiscent of the space of pure states in Quantum Mechanics -, endowing the set of objects with a metric space structure that is exploited to quantify the interactions among objects and encode them into a weighed graph on the vertex set of objects and with object interactions as edge weights. Now objects (genes) are parts of an organised system (cell, tissue, organism). Therefore their mutual interactions are not just independent random variables; they are interconnected through precise, although certainly very complicated and mostly unknown relationships. We seek to reveal (hidden and unknown) interactions among genes. This is achieved by trading the weighed graph representation for a low- dimensional representation and using spectral properties of the weighed Laplacian on the graph to grasp the essential interactions. The following step consists in a fuzzy divisive clustering of objects among two subsets by exploiting the previous low-dimensional representation. This procedure assigns a fuzzy membership to each object relative to characters of the two subsets. Fuzziness is as a matter of fact a distinctive property of experimental biological data reflecting our incomplete knowledge of fundamental biological processes. Up to this step, our method is a sequence of known algorithms that have been previously used separately in the literature in various contexts. The novelty of our method relies on the following steps. The previous fuzzy clustering reduced the in- determinacy of the system. This information is fed back to the system to perform a projection to a proper Hilbert subspace. In that way, the information content of the dataset is modified by the information gained by the previous observations. After this feeding back, the three previous steps are repeated but now referring to a Hilbert spaces of lower dimension. Therefore our method is not a mere fuzzy clustering algo- rithm but a genuine non-classical interaction information retrieval procedure where previous observations alter the informational content of the system, reminiscent of the measurement procedure in Quantum Mechanics."

The dataset is a |B| x |A| matrix X = (xba)beB,aEA of real or complex elements, where | . | represents cardinality. Equivalent ways of represent- ing the dataset are \u00b7 a collection of |B| row vectors xb = (xb1, ... , xbJA|), b E B of RIA| (or CIAI), \u00b7 a collection of |A| column vectors x\u00aa = (x1a, .. . , X|B|a), a \u20ac A of R|B| (or C|B|). Example 1. In the experiments we analysed B is a set of 12000 human genes and A a set of 12 tissular contexts. The matrix elements xba are real numbers encoding luminescence intensities (or their logarithms) of DNA array ultimately representing the level of expression of gene b in context a. Example 2. Let B be a set of books in a library and A a set of bibliographic keywords. The matrix elements xba can be {0, 1}-valued: if the term a is present in the book b then xba = 1 else xba = 0. A variant of this example is when xba are integer valued: if the term a appears k times in document b then xba = k. Example 3. Let B be a set of students and A a set of papers they gave. The matrix elements xba are real valued; xba is the mark the student b got in paper a. The previous examples demonstrate the versatility of the method by keeping the formalism at an abstract level to apply indistinctively into various very different sit- uations without any change. Note also that the assignment as set of documents or at- tributes is a matter of point of view; for instance, example 3 as it stands is convenient in evaluating students. Interchanging the role of sets A and B renders it adapted to the evaluation of teaching. As a rule of thumb, in biological applications, |A| \u00ab |B|. 2.2 The space of concepts For A and B as in the previous subsection, we define the space of concepts, HA, as the real or complex free vector space over A, i.e. elements of A serve as indices of an orthonormal basis of HA. Therefore, the complete dataset X can be represented as the collection of |B| vectors | Eb) = LaEA Xba | a> E HA, with b & B and where | a) represents the element of the orthonormal basis of the free vector space corre- sponding to the attribute a. We use here Dirac's notation to represent vectors, linear forms and projectors on this space (see any book on quantum mechanics or [26] for a freely accessible document and [29] for the use of this notation in information retrieval). The vector | Eb ) contains all available experimental information on docu- ment b in various cellular contexts indexed by the attributes a; it can be thought as a convenient bookkeeping device of the data (xba)aEA, in the same way a generating function contains all the information on a sequence as formal power series."

The vector space is equipped with a scalar product defined for every two vectors [ \u03c8) = \u03a3\u03b1\u0398\u0391 \u03a8\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1) and | \u03c8') = \u03a3\u03b1\u0398\u0391 \u03a8\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1) by (\u03c8| \u03c8') = \u03a3\u03b1\u0398\u0391 \u03a8\u03b1\u03a8\u03b1, where \u03a8\u03b1 denotes the complex conjugate of Va (it coincides with Va if it is real). Equipped with this scalar product, the vector space HA becomes a real or complex |A|-dimensional Hilbert space. The scalar product induces a Hilbert norm on the space, denoted by || . |. In the sequel we introduce also rays on the Hilbert space i.e. normalised vectors. Since the dataset X does not in principle verify any particular numerical constraints, rays are constructed by dividing vectors by their norms. We use the symbol | \u00a7b ) = |b>/|||=b>| to denote the ray associated with vector | Eb ). The Hilbert space structure on HA allows a natural geometrisation of the space of documents by equipping it with a pseudo-distance3 d : B x B -> R+ defined by d(b,b') = | <b > - | <b>|. What is important here is not the precise form of the pseudo-metric structure of (B,d); several other pseudo-distances can be introduced, not necessarily compatible with the scalar product. In this paper we stick however to the previous pseudo-distance, postponing into a later publication explanations about the significance of other pseudo-distances. As is the case in Quantum Mechanics, the Hilbert space description incorporates into a unified algebraic framework all logical and probabilistic information hold by the dataset. An enquiry of the type \"does the system possess feature F\" is encoded into a projector PF acting on the Hilbert space. The subspace associated with the pro- jector PF is interpreted as the set of documents retrieved by asking the question about the feature F. Now all experimental information hold by the dataset is encoded into the state of the system represented by a density matrix p (i.e. a self-adjoint, positive, trace class operator acting on HA having unit trace). Retrieved documents possess the feature F with probability tr(pPF). Thus the algebraic description incorporates logical information on the documents retrieved as relevant to a given feature and assign them a probability determined by the state defined by the experiment. For ex- ample, the probability that a gene b is relevant to an attribute a is given by the above formula with P = |a) {a | and p = |\u00a7 >{6 |, yielding tr(pp) = {6 |a ) |2. 3 A weighed graph with augmented vertex set The careful reader has certainly already noted that in the above description vectors | 5b), encoding the information about document b, and basis vectors |a), associated with attribute a, all belong to the same Hilbert space HA. Therefore, although ini- tially the sets A and B are disjoint since they have distinct elements, when passing to the Hilbert space representation, vectors | \u0160b ) and | a) have very similar roles in representing indistinguishably objects or attributes as vectors of HA. In the sequel, we introduce the set V (or more precisely VA to remove any ambiguity) as the set VA = AUB. Thus, for any v E VA, 3 It is termed pseudo-distance since it verifies symmetry and triangle inequality but d(b,b') can vanish even for different b and b'. As a matter of fact, d is a distance on the projective Hilbert space."

Note that since these new vectors are also elements of the same Hilbert space, the pseudo- distance d naturally extends to VA. Suppose now that a similarity function o : VA \u00d7 VA -> [0,1] is defined. For the sake of definiteness, the reader can think of o as being given, for example4, by (v,v') = 11-zd(v, v')2; results we quote in section 5 are obtained with a slight modification of this similarity function. However, again, the precise form of the similarity function is irrelevant in the abstract setting serving as foundation of the method. Several other similarity functions have been used like, for example, (v,v/) = exp(-|Ev - Ey |2 /t) with t a positive constant or some others, in par- ticular, functions taking value 0 even for some vertices corresponding to non or- thogonal rays but the explanation of their significance is postponed to a subsequent publication. A weighed graph is now constructed with vertex set VA. Weights are assigned to the edges of the complete graph over VA; the weights being expressible in terms of the similarity function o. Again, the precise expression is irrelevant for the ex- position of the method. For the sake of concreteness, the reader can suppose that the weights Www are given by Www = @(v, v'). The pair (VA, W) with W being the symmetric matrix W = (Www) v,VEVA, denotes the weighed graph. At this level of the description we follow now standard techniques of reduction of the data dimensionality by optimal representation of the graph in low dimensional Euclidean spaces spanned by eigenvectors of the Laplacian. Such methods have been used by several authors [4, 24]. Here we give only the basic definitions and main results of this method. The interested reader may consult standard textbooks like [8, 10, 15] for general exposition of the method. Definition 1. A map r : VA -> RY is called a v-dimensional representation of the graph. The representation is always supposed non-trivial (i.e. r # 0) and balanced (i.e. EvEVAr(\u03bd) =0). From the weights matrix W we construct the weighed Laplacian matrix A = D - W where the matrix elements Dw are O if v / v' and equal to Ey\"EVA Www\" if v = v'. More precisely, we denote by A (VA) this weighed Laplacian to indicate that it is defined on the vertex set VA. This precision will be necessary in the next section specifying the semantic distillation algorithm where the vertex set will be recursively modified at each step. The weighed energy of the representation is given by &w (r) = > Ww/lr(v) - r(v)|2, v,v'EVA where in this formula | . | denotes the Euclidean norm of Rv. 4 This function is well adapted to datasets X = (xba), with xba E R+; for more general datasets, the factor 1/2 must be changed to 1/4."

It starts with the Hilbert space HA and the graph with vertex set VA and constructs a se- quence of Hilbert subspaces and subgraphs indexed by the words K of finite length on a two-letter alphabet. This set is isomorphic to a subset of the rooted binary tree. If K is the root, then define MK = A. Otherwise, MK will be a proper subset of A, i.e. 0 \u2103 MK C A,indexed by K. When |MK| = 1 then the corresponding K is a leaf of the binary tree. The algorithm stops when all indices correspond to leaves. More precisely, let K = {1,2}, K\u00ba = {K : K = ()}, and for integers n \u2265 1 let K\" = { K : K = K] . . . Kn; K; E K}.

We observe that the majority of genes classified as most specific by our method are in fact annotated as specific in the database. To underline the power of our method, note that the UniGene annotation for the ATPase gene is \"cardiac mus- cle\". Our method determines it as most specific of \"skeletal muscle\". We checked the experimental data we worked on and realised that this gene is, as a matter of fact, 5 times more expressed in the skeletal muscle context than in the cardiac muscle. Therefore, our method correctly determines this gene as skeletal-muscle-specific. In summarising, our method is an automatic and algorithmic method of analy- sis of raw experimental data; it can be used to any experiment of similar type in- dependently of any previous knowledge included in genomic databases to provide biologists with a powerful tool of analysis. In particular, since most of the genes are not yet annotated in the existing databases, the method provides biologists with candidate genes for every particular context for further investigation.

Concerning the algorithmic complexity of the method, the dominant contribution comes from the diagonalisation of a |B| x |B| dense real symmetric matrix, requiring at worst @(|B|3) time steps and (|B|2) space. The time complexity can be slightly reduced, if only low-dimensional (dimension v) representations are sought, to 6 (v x |B|2) time steps. Moreover, we tested the method against additive or multiplicative random perturbations of the experimental data; it proved astonishingly robust. 6 Connections to previous work The algorithm of semantic distillation maps the dataset into a graph and uses spectral methods and fuzzy clustering to analyse the graph properties. As such, this algorithm is inspired by various pre-existing algorithms and borrows several elements from them. The oldest implicit use of a vector space structure to represent dataset and appli- cation of spectral methods to analyse them is certainly \"principal components anal- ysis\" introduced in [25]. The method seeks finding directions of maximal variability in the space corresponding to linear combinations of the underlying vectors. The major drawbacks of principal components analysis are the assumptions that dataset matrix is composed of row vectors that are independent and identically distributed realisations of the same random vector (hence the covariance matrix whose princi- pal components are sought can be approximated by the empirical covariance of the process) and that there exists a linear transformation maximising the variability. Vector space representations and singular value decomposition, as reviewed in [5], have been used to retrieve information from digital libraries. Implementations of these ideas range from the famous PageRank algoritm used by Google (see [18]"

From the information contained in the dataset X, a weighed graph of interactions among documents is constructed. To palliate the weaknesses of principal component analysis, reproducing kernel methods can be used. The oldest account of these meth- ods seems to be [21] and their formulation in the context of Hilbert spaces can be found in [1]. In [31], analysis of features of a microarray experiment is proposed based on kernel estimates on a graph. Note however that in that paper, the graph in- corporates extrinsic information coming from participation of genes in specific path- ways as documented in the KEGG database. On the contrary, in the method we are proposing here, the graph can be constructed in an intrinsic way, even in the absence of any additional information from existing databases. In [4, 9, 24], kernel methods and Laplace eigenspace decomposition are used to generalise principal components analysis to include non-linear interactions among genes. Particular types of kernels, defined in terms of commuting times for a random walk on the graph are used in [13, 20, 30]. All these methods, although not always explicitly stated in these arti- cles, are as a matter of fact very closely related since the kernels, the weighed graph Laplacian and the simple random walk on the graph can be described in a unified formalism [7, 8, 10, 15, 22]. It is worth noting that analysis of Laplacian of the graph is used in many different contexts, ranging from biological applications (proteins conformation [32], gene arrays [23]) to web search [3] or image analysis [28]. Fuzzy clustering has been introduced in [6]; lately it was shown [33] equivalent to probabilistic clustering if the objective function is expressed in terms of the R\u00e9nyi entropy. The idea of describing the data in terms of abstract Hilbert spaces has been used (in the context of database search) in [2, 12, 14, 29, 34]. The semantic distillation algorithm is based on a quantum-inspired subspace pro- jection, strongly reminiscent of the quantum procedure of measurement. Although fully implemented on classical computers, it shares with general quantum algorithms features of non-distributive quantum logic [26, 27]. The semantic approach of Quan- tum Mechanics can be found in [27, 11]. It is worth underlying that the full fledged fuzzy logic induced by quantum semantics is not equivalent to the standard fuzzy logic introduced in [36]; it represents a genuine extension of it [11]. 7 Perspectives Various data sets (not only biological) are presently semantically distilled and the method compared with more traditional approaches. Preliminary results obtained so far seem to confirm the power of the method. Several directions are in progress: \u00b7 Although the method is quantum-inspired, the fuzzy logic induced is still stan- dard fuzzy logic. We are currently working on the extension to generalised fuzzy logic induced by full-fledged quantum semantics."
