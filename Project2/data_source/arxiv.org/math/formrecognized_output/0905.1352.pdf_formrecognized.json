MANI Member, Calcutta Mathematical Society 9/1B, Jatin Bagchi Road Kolkata(Calcutta)-700029, India a.mani@member.ams.org Home Page: http://amani.topcities.com Abstract. Both algebraic and computational approaches for dealing with similarity spaces are well known in generalized rough set theory. However, these studies may be said to have been confined to particu- lar perspectives of distinguishability in the context. In this research, the essence of an algebraic semantics that can deal with all possible concepts of distinguishability over similarity spaces is progressed. Key to this is the addition of choice-related operations to the semantics that have con- nections with modal logics as well. Among these we focus on a semantics that is based on local clear distinguishability over similarity spaces. 1 Introduction By a Tolerance Approximation Space (TAS), we mean a pair of the form S = (S, T), with S being a set and T a tolerance relation over it - these are also known as similarity or tolerance spaces. Some references for extension of classical rough set theory to TAS are [1] [2], and [3]. The type of granules used in these theories is summarized below. An approach ([1]) has been to define a new equivalence 00 on S via (x, y) E 00 if and only if dom(x) = domT(y) with domT(z) = [{[x]T : 2 \u20ac [x]]}. This is essentially an unduly cautious 'clear perspective' approach. A somewhat natural generalization of the approximation space semantics us- ing T-related sets (or tolerance sets) can be described from the point of view of generalized covers (see [4]). This includes the approach of defining [x]T = {y; (x, y) E T} and the lower and upper approximation of a set A as, Al = U{[x]T; [x]] [ A} and Au = {[x]T ; [x]T n A = 0, x E A}. A bited modifi- cation proposed in [5], valid for many definable concepts of granules, consists in defining a bited upper approximation. Algebraic semantics of the same has been considered by the present author in [6]. It is also shown that a full representation theorem is not always possible for the semantics. In [2], the approximations Al* = {x; (By) (x, y) E T, [y]] [ A} and Au* = {x; (Vy) ((x, y) ET -> [y]TnA = 0)}. are introduced. It can be shown that, for any subset A, AL C Al* C A C Au* C Au"

        "page_content": "In the BZ andQuasi-BZ algebraic semantics ([7]), the lower and upper rough operators are generated by a preclusivity operator and the complementation re- lation on the power set of the approximation space, or on a collection of sets un- der suitable constraints in a more abstract setting. Semantically the BZ-algebra and variants do not capture all the possible ways of arriving at concepts of distinguishability over similarity spaces. Whereas the quasi-BZ lattice does not encompass a paradigm shift relative the BZ-algebra, the BZMV variants are designed to capture fuzzy aspects. In subjective terms, reducts are minimal sets of attributes that preserve the quality of classification. An important problem is in getting good scalable algo- rithms for the computation of the different types of reducts (or supersets that are close to them) (see [8]). These depend on the concept of granules used. For TAS, most of the above concepts of granules and approximation often lead to computational difficulties. Though our theory can be expected to improve the computational situation, the main motivation for the present work is centred around our new concept of local clear distinguishability. Definition 1. Let P = (P, <> be a partially ordered set and if A is any subset of P, let its lower and upper cone be L(A) = {x; (Va E A) x \u2264 a} and U(A) = {x; (Va E A) a \u2264 x} respectively. A function A : (P) => P will be said to be lattice-coherent with < if and only if the condition a < b then >(L(a, b)) = a and >(U(a, b)) = b. By a choice function x on a set S, we mean a function x : p(S) > S, which is such that (Vx \u20ac S) x({x}) = x and (VA E p(S) x(A) E A. 2 Philosophical Basis In this research we deal with choice-based rough granulation as opposed to basing choice forms over rough granulation. Choice is needed to specify the admissible granulation in the theory. A cautious way of saying that a set of things are essentially indistinguishable is to say that they are mutually indistinguishable. If we are to stick to this principle, then given a subset A of a TAS S, the essentially indistinguishable subsets of A are the intersections of the blocks of the relation T with A. In course of constructing an upper approximation of A, we can form all the unions of disjoint blocks (as opposed to union of all blocks) that intersect with A. The operation enshrines a natural concept of clarity in the process of categorisation. The other option fails to do so. This preference can be viewed as a local equivalence-based perspective in the context. It is implicit that 'at a local level' the concept of distinguishability is based on disjoint categories. The loss of uniqueness in the construction can be dealt with through suitable choice functions that are latent in the context. By the local clear distinguishability principle (LCP), we mean the re- quirement that definite objects generated by approximation context initiators should be made up of nonintersecting granules. The most appropriate domain of discourse for general rough set theory and this concept should avoid ZF sets,"

        "page_content": "but for simplicity's sake we use the latter. A context initiator may be the subset under consideration or a variant thereof depending on the application context. The local part is, because we restrict to granules generated from these objects. For example, if we perceive a subset A = {a1, a2, ... an} of a TAS S in the given order, and use a 'First In First Out' (FIFO) principle in the generation of a maximal set of disjoint blocks contained within A, then the final outcome is determined by the 'order of perception' and the 'generation principle'. I will consider a perfect technical formulation of the concept in a separate paper as the fine details are not explicitly required in our theory. In learning theory, it can be interesting to know the structure of contextual knowledge that is guided by the local clear distinguishability principle. The latter in essence is a strategy for forming a clear concept of context-dependent knowledge. This is in line with Pawlak's concept of knowledge in classical rough set theory, where if S is a set of attributes, then sets of the form Al and Au represent clear and definite concepts. If Q is another stronger equivalence on S, then the state of the knowledge encoded by (S, Q) is a refinement of that of S = (S, P). The entire set S will not be a union of disjoint blocks in general and we will be able to find maximal collections of mutually disjoint blocks. Deciding on what ought to be the upper approximation of S and the following are necessary. If a set that seems to be an upper approximation of another given set A (say) on the basis of nonempty intersection of blocks with A, fails to satisfy the local clarity paradigm on application of a strategy similar to that used for the lower approximation, then we can - Take the upper approximation of A to be undefined - Relax the local clarity paradigm and take the upper approximation as S - Relax the inclusion of the set in its upper approximation by way of selecting a union of a set of disjoint blocks from the set of all blocks that intersect the set A in question. - Take the upper approximation to be one of the unions of maximal collections of mutually disjoint blocks - Relax the local clarity paradigm and take the relevant upper approximation to be the same as the union of blocks that intersect the set A in question. In TAS, it can be suspected that approximations of the above kind actually improve the information content of possible semantics to the point that we have good representation theorems as well. In this paper we develop an elegant se- mantics with the the first option for the concept of an upper approximation (for the other options see [9]) and show that this is indeed the case. Interestingly the restriction that if a set is a union of disjoint blocks, then it ought to be exact (or crisp) in conjunction with the above choice scenario turns out to be the basis of a nonmonotone variation of the theory ([9]). In all this, the nature of the choice process consists in selecting particular subcollections of mutually disjoint blocks from sets of such collections. It can be argued that the approximation contexts generated by TAS should involve more than the concepts of lower and upper approximation and perhaps"

        "page_content": "a gradation of the concept. Our semantic approach actually supports this and in fact we think that anything less than four must involve loss of information. Also any reasonable gradation must necessarily depend on the topology on the TAS or a variant of the notion. But we will not explicitly refer to such structures in this paper. Rough approximation in its general forms is distinct from approximation in its ability to include clear means of categorisation in the approximation. So in comparing different types of rough approximation, a simple concept of fineness of the approximation can never be a suitable criteria for differentiating between approximation methodologies. The lower approximation of a set using the equiv- alence 00 mentioned in the introduction will be very close to the set and so will the upper approximation be. 'Closeness to the set in question' is not a suffi- cient criteria for deciding among the concepts of approximation as it often ends up violating a variety of context-dependent coherence criteria. Such insufficient criterias have been used often in the literature. 3 Essential A-Rough Partial Algebras Let S = (S, T) be a TAS, A C S be an arbitrary subset of it and let S be the collection of all blocks of T.

In general if we apply the 0-upper approximation construction to a set of the form Al0, then we will get a larger set. The other parts can be verified by direct set-theoretic arguments. For the last two claims note that, Al* = {x; (By) (x, y) E T, [y]] [ A} Au* = {x; (Vy) ((x, y) ET -> [y]T n A = 0)} and that a block cannot contain any other blocks. Note that the property A10 C (A10)20 also happens in esoteric rough set theory [[10]]. When we redefine situations in which the 0-upper approximations are undefined with those values set to S, then the whole of the behaviour (as far as the two approximations 10 and the new u0 are concerned) resembles that of rough set theory over partial approximation spaces. Lateral approximations do not encompass discernibility at the local level. So we do not think that they constitute a reasonable rough concept by them- selves. The other non modal approximations indicated in the introduction are still distinct from these. They can be obtained through suitable modifications. Parts-(g) and (h) of the above therem have a deep role to play in deciding on the direction of possible representation theorems. The propositions ensure that we can identify unions of disjoint blocks using the approximation operators. Theorem 2. If we define the operations ~, e over the power set @(S) via (the latter being a partial operation that is defined only when Au0 is) ~ A = S \\ A\u017d O A = S \\ Au0, then it is necessary that A C ~~ A, but in general A & e e A, even when the right hand side is defined."

Note that Uo is a partial operation. Further we will write IU (a, b, .. ) for IU (a), IU (b), ... - IN(x) if and only if ex = or.

Since an essential A-rough partial algebra is a concrete object, we will assume x = [A], y = [B] for some suitable subsets A, B. (a) If either side is defined, then the other is defined and is equal to Vo[Au0 U Bu0] = [(Au0 U Bu0)u0]. The next part follows in the same way. If defined, x Y x = [(Au Au0)[0] = [(Au)[0] = VoVox. The last part follows in the same way. (b) For any element A of a class x, Lo(x) is the class of A10, while L(x) is the class of AL. Lo(x) \u2264 L(x) follows from the previously proved properties of the approximations as applied to the sets A10 and A . L(x) { x (x) follows in the same way. In the second part (IU(x) means that for each of the elements of x, the 0-upper approximation exists and they must all be equal to each other. Now if A E x, then Au0 \u20ac Uo(x) and if B E Uo(x), then (Au)* C B* , where * is any of the four approximations. So we have IU (x) -> x \u2264 Uo(x)). (c) If A E LoLo(x) then it must be of the form Blo for some B E Lo(x), as for any B E Lo(x) we must have Al0 BroloZO = B10. The equality LoLo(x) = Lo(x) follows as a consequence. If Uo(x) is defined, then VoVo(x) will also be defined, for any A E x, it is possible that Au0 \u2103 AuOu0, so IU(x) -> Uo(x) \u2264 UoUo(x) (d) If A E Lo(x), then it is already a union of disjoint blocks and Al will be equal to it, so A E LLo(x). As the converse inclusion is trivial so LLo(x) = Lo(x). The second part follows by a similar argument. (e) If A E L(x), then AL E LL(x) as A=A\" Now if B E LL(x), then there is a C E \u013d(x) such that BU = C\u0168, B10 = Cul0 and so on for the other approximations. But the first equality means that Bl = Cl. So LL(x) = \u013d(x). If defined, elements of Uo(x) are themselves identical unions of disjoint blocks, each of whose 0-lower approximations are the same. So the con- clusion LoVo(x) = Uo(x) follows"

Using those two elements as representatives of the class, it can be seen that its U approximation cannot be a disjoint union of blocks. So s(U(x) = 0 and Lo(x) { x. For the converse, a contradiction argument using the class of a one-element, and more than two element sets yields the result.

(r) The proof of ~ ~ ~ L(x) \u2264~ Lo(x) is similar to the proof of the above.

Given an abstract essential A-rough partial algebra S there exists a tolerance approximation space and a choice perspective that ensures that its algebraic semantics is isomorphic to S. Proof. Our abridged proof has three components (roughly). The first concerns the reconstruction of the tolerance approximation space, the second part of the choice perspective and the third part of compatibility builds into the first two. Let S be an AER as in the above definition. Then the statements 11, 16 - 21 and the definitions of \u2264, s, t, ensure that we can reconstruct a tolerance T on a set K (corresponds to 1) by the representation theorem of tolerance relations (see [11]). LI is needed for getting the set K in a easier way. We do not have a full representation here. Both the operations Lo and Uo permit the isolation of the choice function used as blocks can be identified through the function s and combined via U, while maximal unions of mutually disjoint blocks can be identified and any union of blocks is constructible. 5 Further Directions: Modal Connections A relational structure, in particular a TAS, can be associated with many modal logics by way of induced global operations through suitable modification of the theory of Tarski algebras (see [12]). Importantly, the semantics developed above can be combined with such modal semantics ([9]). Choice functions induced by modalities are also considered in the same paper by the present author. A stronger abstract representation theorem is proved for many of the contexts; This is partly due to the partial representation results in [12]. See the same for undefined concepts in this section. In particular, if S is the set of blocks of a TAS S, then K = (S, S) is a dense Tarski set. Let A(S) be the set of subsets that are unions of 'a complement of"

        "page_content": "a block and a subset of it'. Then X = (A(S), =>, S) is a Tarski Subalgebra of (S), where => is defined via U => V = (S \\ U) U V. The set of maximal filters of X allow a representation theorem in the finite case. The form of A(S) in the above is actually dictated by the choice of S, which may be taken to be the collection of unions of disjoint blocks among other things. Proposition 3. If the rough equivalence o of the previous section is applied on A(S), then the resulting classes are of two types: those that correspond to complements of a block and those that correspond to unions of complement of a block and a little more. The implication-like operations on an AER are clearly different from that of modal Tarski algebras and the best way of getting to a unified semantics is still not fully solved (even in [9]). We can also adjoin arbitrary modal operations to an AER. The connections with other similarity semantics and logics can be found in more detail in the same paper. References 1.
