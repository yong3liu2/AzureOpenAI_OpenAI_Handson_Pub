        "page_content": "The Real truth Stefano Baratella Domenico Zambella Abstract We study a real valued propositional logic with unbounded positive and negative truth values that we call R-valued logic. Such a logic is semantically equivalent to continuous propositional logic, with a different choice of connectives. After presenting the deduction machinery and the semantics of R-valued logic, we prove a completeness theorem for finite theories. Then we define unital and Archimedean theories, in accordance with the theory of Riesz spaces. In the unital setting, we prove the equivalence of consistency and satisfiability and an approximated completeness theorem similar to the one that holds for con- tinuous propositional logic. Eventually, among unital theories, we characterize Archimedean theories as those for which strong completeness holds. We also point out that R-valued logic provides alternative calculi for \u0141ukasiewicz logic and for propositional continuous logic. arXiv:1205.0674v2 [math.LO] 14 Dec 2014 1 Introduction Many-valued logics date back to the very early development of mathematical logic. The real unit interval [0, 1] has in particular been a favorite set of truth values. Among [0, 1]-valued logics, \u0141ukasiewicz logic occupies a predominant place (see e.g. [H\u00e1j98]). Initially motivated by philosophical considerations and scientific curiosity, \u0141ukasiewicz logic has received considerable attention by philosophers and computer scientists working on fuzzy logics, approximate reasoning or other forms of non- classical reasoning. On the algebraic side, the study of \u0141ukasiewicz logic led to the notion of an MV-algebra. C.C. Chang first showed that MV-algebras provide a complete semantics for \u0141ukasiewicz logic. See [Cha58], [Cha59]. Continuous logic makes its first appearence in [BYU10]. Its propositional fragment extends \u0141ukasiewicz logic. See, for instance, the overview in [BYP10]. In spite of appearing just an extension of \u0141ukasiewicz logic, continuous logic has an independent origin and different motivations. Actually, it builds on a field of research, initiated in the 1980's by Henson and continued by a number of authors, on the model theory of so called metric structures. Continuous logic provides a suitable logical setting for dealing with structures like Banach spaces, Banach algebras, probability algebras, etc. that arise in functional analysis or probability theory.

        "page_content": "As the origin of continuous logic lies in model theory, issues like developing deduc- tion systems and studying their completeness have been somewhat postponed. A completeness theorem for continuous predicate logic appears in [BYP10]. The au- thors make use of results from [BY], where a completeness result for propositional continuous logic is derived from the corresponding result for \u0141ukasiewicz logic. Being [0, 1]-valued, continuous logic apparently deals with bounded structures only. Such a limitation can be overcome by allowing many-sorted structures, but the many-sorted approach suffers from some drawbacks (see [BY08]). Those can only be avoided by passing to a genuine logic for unbounded structures: one such logic has been introduced in [BY08]. Strongly related to our work is an unbounded real valued logic that predates [BY08] and has been introduced with different motivations. We refer to the abelian logic of [MS89] (independently introduced in [Cas89]). In [MS89], the authors provide a sound and complete axiomatization of abelian logic with respect to the class of abelian l-groups (equivalently: with respect to the l-group of the reals). The con- nections between abelian and \u0141ukasiewicz logic and calculi for both logics have been studied in [MOG04]. Among other results, in [MOG04] the authors prove soundness and completeness of a hypersequent calculus and of labelled and unlabelled sequent calculi for abelian logic. They also establish the computational complexity of the labelled calculus. In this paper we develop a syntactic calculus in Hilbert style for a real-valued propo- sitional logic, named R-valued logic. Our logic can be viewed as an extension of abelian logic. As already mentioned, abelian logic is the logic of lattice-ordered abelian groups, which has the reals among its characteristic models. Ours is the logic of lattice-ordered vector spaces, also known as Riesz spaces (see [AB85]). As proved in Section 5, R-valued logic has the reals among its characteristic models (see, in particular, Remark 17 below). From the syntactic viewpoint, R- valued logic comes equipped with scalar multiplication as an additional formation rule for formulas. In this paper we restrict scalar multiplication to multiplication by rationals in order not to rule the possibility of working with a countable language (this might be useful in future developments). The results obtained in this paper extend to multiplication by reals in a straightforward manner. There is a natural overlapping of the results proved in this paper with those obtained in [MS89], [MOG04] or, more in general, in the area of mathematical fuzzy logic (see [AA.11a] and [AA.11b] for a comprehensive and up-to-date presentation of the latter). Nevertheless the proof techniques used in the different contexts have their own distinctive vein: algebraic (in this paper); logically-minded (in [MS89]) and proof-theoretic (in [MOG04]). The different contexts in which abelian and R-valued logic are developed may make a step-by-step translation of one logic into the other not completely straightforward. We do not investigate that issue because we believe that the strong connections between the two logics are witnessed, beyond any doubt, by their respective completeness theorems. 2"

        "page_content": "Yet we may say that some of the completeness results proved in this paper can be regarded as extensions of those in [MS89] or in [MOG04], as they apply to a logic more expressive than abelian logic. A further reason why, in our opinion, R-valued logic is worth being investigated is that it creates a link between the two independently developed areas of continuous logic and of mathematical fuzzy logic. We shall investigate a predicate extension of RR-valued logic in a future work. As already mentioned, a syntactic calculus for predicate continuous logic is presented in [BYP10], while the semantics of unbounded continuous logic is introduced in [BY08]. From the latter it is evident that there is no straightforward interpretation of the quantifiers in the unbounded case. Difficulties are also met on the abelian logic side. Predicate extensions of abelian logic are very quickly sketched in [MS89, \u00a7X], where the authors admit their conflicting ideas about the treatment of quantifiers. In any case, ours remains a necessary step towards a possible predicate extension. In the framework of R-valued logic we introduce a notion of theory and, under suitable assumptions on theories, we prove different formulations of completeness with respect to a semantics that we introduce in Section 2. In Section 3 we introduce the syntactic calculus of R-valued logic, which turns out to be quite different from the one introduced in [BYP10] and [BY]. Having in mind the axiomatization of Riesz spaces (i.e. of lattice-ordered vector spaces, see [AB85]), our logical axioms turn out to be quite natural. As for deduction rules, we show that modus ponens alone does not suffice to get completeness. For this reason we have to introduce two additional rules. Then we prove a number of properties of our provability relation, including the correctness of a sort of cut rule, see Proposition 8. It is a standard terminology to say that, in a given logic, strong completeness holds for a set E of formulas if \u03a3 = \u03c6 if and only if \u03a3 - \u03c6, for every formula \u03c6. If the previous property holds for all (finite) 2, one says that (finite) strong completeness holds for that logic. We recall that finite strong completeness holds for \u0141ukasiewicz logic and for continuous propositional logic. In Section 4 we prove finite strong completeness of R-valued logic with respect to a suitable subclass of formulas. The proof is obtained by reducing finite strong completeness to a problem in convex analysis, whose solution is provided by suitable formulations of Farkas' Lemma. In Section 5 we extend the completeness theorem obtained in Section 4 to all formu- las. At the end of Section 5 we also show that R-valued logic provides alternative calculi for \u0141ukasiewicz logic and for continuous propositional logic. Another weak formulation of completeness, namely the equivalence of consistency and satisfiability, holds for \u0141ukasiewicz logic and for continuous propositional logic. We refer to the equivalence of consistency and satisfiability as weak completeness. Continuous propositional logic also satisfies a further weak version formulation of 3"

        "page_content": "completeness, a so called approximated completeness (see [BYP10]). We show that validity of corresponding results in R-valued logic is not granted without an addi- tional hypothesis, as not every consistent set of assumptions extends to a maximal consistent one. In Section 6 we define the classes of unital and Archimedean theories. We show that weak and approximated completeness (in the sense of continuous logic) both hold for unital theories. Finally, among unital theories, we characterize Archimedean theories as those for which strong completeness holds. 2 Formulas, structures and theories In this section we begin the description of R-valued logic. We remain rather informal, in order not to bother a supposedly experienced reader with a number of minor details. We identify a language L with its extralogical symbols. So language L is a set of symbols that we call proposition letters. The set of formulas is the least set containing the proposition letters and closed under the connectives in the set {0, +, } u Q, where 0 is a logical constant; rational numbers are unary connectives; +, A are binary connectives. Our choice of connectives is inspired by Riesz spaces (see [AB85]), in the same way as the connectives of classical logic are inspired by Boolean algebras. We also consider an extension of logical symbols obtained by adding the logical constant 1. We shall refer to these two settings as the restricted and the extended case respectively. More explicitly, all proposition letters are formulas and, if 4 and v are formulas, then so are: 0. 0 and, in the extended case, 1; 1. 4 + 5; 2. WA\u0106; qy for every q E Q. Actually, we have been informal above as, for instance, braces will soon appear. We write -4 for (-1)4 and 4 - 4 for 4+ (-4). We write y vy for -(-4A-4). We also borrow some notation from Riesz spaces: 4+ and 4\" stand for 0 v 4 and 0 v (-4) respectively. We write |4| for ov (-4). In the extended case, we abbreviate q1 with q, for all q e Q. A structure, or model, for a language L is a function M : L -> R. In the extended case we further require that M takes values in the interval [-1,1]. This semantic requirement and its axiomatic counterpart (axiom a15 below) are motivated by the consequences of Proposition 9 below. Let M be a model. We recursively define YM for an arbitrary formula y as follows: 4"

We use the word inequality as a synonym for an ordered pair of formulas. In- equalities are denoted by writing & \u2264v. In order to simplify notation, we abbreviate the inequality 0 \u2264 4 with 4. A theory is a binary relation on the set of formulas, namely a set of inequalities. We elaborate on this definition of theory in Remark 10 below. If M is a model and & < > we write M = { { } and we say that & < < holds in M. If T is a theory, we define M = T and T = 6 5 4 in the usual way. We write M=0<4 if 0 < 4M. Finally, we write Th(M) for the set of inequalities that hold in M. We finish this section by commenting on our choice of logical connectives. The presence of a unary connective for each element of Q is just a matter of convenience. Alternative meaningful choices are {-1} or { -- }. Together with addition, the former singleton yields a connective for each element of Z. The latter yields a connective for each element of the set D of dyadic rationals. With respect to both choices, logical axioms for lattice modules replace those for vector lattices that occur in our setting. Having in mind an extension to the predicate case, we opt for a complete (in the sense of [BYU10]) set of connectives. In this regard, D and Q are equivalent choices. 3 Logical axioms and derivations The following inequalities, where 4, y and \u00a7 range over all formulas, are called logical axioms. We write ( = { to denote the theory {} } }, { { }}. So an axiom expressing an equality (see below) actually stands for a pair of axioms. We also write & < < < 4 to denote the theory { { }, { { }. The reader can make sense by her-/him-self of some other minor notational abuses. In the following, Q+ denotes the set of nonnegative rationals. There are two axiom groups. The axioms from the first group are chosen having in mind the theory of vector spaces over Q: a1. 6+4 = 4+4 a2. (+)+\u00a7 = ++ (++\u00a7) a3. 6+0 = 4 a4. 16 = 4 a5. 04 = 0 a6. r4+84 = (s+r)4 a7. rp ++4= r(6+4) a8. r (sv) = (rs)4 5"

Notice that there is no formula that plays the role of a contradiction in the restricted case. 10 Remark In this remark, which is not relevant for the further technical develop- ments, we motivate our definition of theory. In the theory of Boolean algebras, there is a well-known correspondence between homomorphisms and filters (equivalently: ideals). We recall that a similar corre- spondence holds for Riesz spaces. If f : E -> L is a homomorphism of Riesz spaces, then F = f-1[0] is a so called solid subspace of E and f factors through the quotient epimorphism T : E -> E/F, where E/F is the quotient Riesz space of E with respect to F. More precisely, there exists a unique Riesz space monomorphism u : E/F -> L such that f = LOT. See [Fre74, \u00a714G] for details. It is also well-known that the quotient of the set of formulas of classical propositional logic with respect to the relation of provable equivalence is a Boolean algebra and that deductively closed set of formulas become filters in such algebra (the improper filter corresponding to any inconsistent set). Also, in R-valued logic, it can be easily verified that the quotient R/~ of the set R of formulas of any fixed language with respect to the equivalence relation defined by 6~4 > +4=4 is a Riesz space, when equipped with the induced operations. So, in order to carry on with the similarities, one should define a theory in R-valued logic as a set T of formulas such that T/~ is a solid subspace. Actually, our definition of theory as a set of inequalities is essentially equivalent to the above. For it is easy to verify that, if T is a theory in our sense, then the set {(6~ ~ ) : I + + { } is a preorder on R/~ which 1. extends the ordering on R/ ~; 2. is compatible with the Riesz space structure (in the sense expressed by deduction rules r1 + r3 above). Moreover, if we replace R/~ with an arbitrary Riesz space E and E is a preorder on E which satisfies 1 and 2 above, then the set F = {v e E : 0 E v = 0} is a solid subspace. Vice versa, if F is a solid subspace of E, by letting v E w => v \u2264 w + c for some ce F, we obtain a preorder that satisfies 1 and 2. To sum up: the definition of theory is just a matter of taste. For us, a theory is essentially a partial ordering on the set of formulas, which can be interpreted by saying that some formula is always truer than some other formula, without reference to a notion of absolute truth. On the contrary, in the alternative setting presented above, the logical constant 0 represents absolute truth, just as in Continuous Logic, and a theory contains all the \"absolutely true\" formulas. 10"

We shall elaborate on this in the next section. 17 Remark With reference to the restricted case, let us generalize the definition of structure given in Section 2. For R a Riesz space, a R-structure is a function M : L -> R. Truth in a R-structure is defined in the natural way and it is easy to verify that the corresponding semantics is sound for R-valued logic. Let us write FR for the relation of logical consequence with respect to the class of all R-structures as R ranges over all Riesz spaces. Then, for all formulas y and all finite theories T, the following are equivalent: 1. T + 6; 2. TER 4; 13"

Any effective enumeration of Q\" induces an enumeration (Mk)kell of all rational valued assignments of val- ues to P1, ... , Pn. The procedure that, at step k, computes 6Mk yields recursive enumerability of {6: + 4}. 19 Remark Extended R-valued logic faithfully interprets \u0141ukasiewicz logic. In order to see that, recall that the connectives -, - form a complete set of connectives for \u0141ukasiewicz logic and notice that they are definable in the extended logic. Moreover, the models of \u0141ukasiewicz logic form an axiomatizable subclass of those of extended R-valued logic, as simply one has to impose the condition 0 \u2264 P on every proposition letter P. From Theorem 16 we get that, for every formula Y(P1, ... , Pn) in the language of \u0141ukasiewicz logic, whose proposition letters are among those displayed, HEY(P1, ... , Pn) P1, ... , Pn - 6(P1, ... , Pn) = 1, where HE and + stand for provability in \u0141ukasiewicz and in the extended R-valued logic respectively. Similar considerations apply to continuous propositional logic, recalling that {-, -, } is a complete set of connectives for such logic. 6 Archimedean theories As usual, we say that a theory T is satisfiable if there exists a structure M such that M = T. In the restricted case satisfiability property is trivial, as every theory is satisfiable in the constant model 0. Hence, in the restricted case, we are actually interested in satisfiability other than in the constant model 0. We say that T is consistent if T H & for some formula 6. We say that T is total if it is consistent and, for every formula y, T + 4 or TH -4, possibly both. In other words T is total if its deductive closure is a non-trivial total preorder on the set of formulas. The reader may verify that T is total if and only if it is prime, namely if and only if it satisfies the property that whenever T 4 vy then THY or THV. 14"

Then T extends to a theory T' that is maximal with respect to the property that T' \u00a7. Proposition 8 implies that T' is total. We say that T is unital if there is a formula \u00a7 such that, for every 4, there is some r E Q+ such that T + p <r$. Such a formula & is called a unit in T. In the extended case, constant 1 is a unit in all theories, as a consequence of Proposition 9. Notice that if \u00a7 is a unit in T, then \u00a7 is a unit in every extension of T. 21 Remark It is straightforward to check that, if \u00a7 is a unit in T, then T is consistent if and only if T + - \u00a7. Moreover, if T is maximal with respect to the latter property, then T is maximal consistent. Therefore unital consistent theories extend to maximal consistent theories. We shall see this is not true in general. 22 Remark Let T be a theory and let & be a formula such that TH Q. Then, by Proposition 8, T,-4 is consistent. We shall repeatedly use this this fact in the sequel without further mention. By the previous remark, every maximal consistent theory is total. In the extended case, Th(M) is trivially total for every model M. The same holds in the restricted case, when M is not the constant model 0. By Proposition 24 below, Th(M) is also maximal consistent. We write T+ for the set of formulas y such that T + Y and T- for the set of formulas Y such that TH -4. If T+ = T- we say that T is trivial. So, if T is non-trivial then T+ \\ T\" is non-empty. Non-trivial theories are consistent: just notice that if \u00a7 \u20ac T+ \\T\" then T + -\u00a7. The converse is not true in general, the empty theory being a counter-example. Complete theories are easily seen to be non-trivial. Consistent unital theories are non-trivial as well. We write Qty for the set {ry : re Q+}. 23 Proposition Let T be a consistent theory and let 6, v be such that T + Q+ + 5 V. Then T, -4 is consistent. Proof. If T, -4 is inconsistent then T, -4 -4. By assumption and by the Deduction Theorem, we get T + Q+4 < r++, for some r \u20ac Q+. From inconsistency of T, - we also get T + & hence T + 6 = p+. Therefore T + -6, contradicting the consistency of T. We say that T is Archimedean if for every 6,4 such that T + Q+6 < & then T + -4. Clearly Th(M) is Archimedean for every structure M. It follows from Theorem 16 that every finite theory is Archimedean. 15"

So T, & is inconsistent. 25 Example There is a total theory T that has no maximal consistent extension. In particular, T is non-Archimedean, non-unital, and has only the constant model 0. We construct such a theory T by using the generalized notion of structure introduced in Remark 17. We are going to define a Q[x]-valued structure M. Recall that Q[x] has an ordered ring structure with respect to the order induced by r < x, for all r E Q. For each i E w, the language of M contains a proposition letter Pi which is interpreted as the monomial x2. Let T be the set of inequalities that hold in M. As the generalized semantics is sound, the theory T is consistent and deductively closed. As the ordering on Q[x] is a linear, T is total. Moreover T + 0 \u2264 Q+Pi \u2264 Pi+1 for all i so, if S is any Archimedean extension of T, then S = Pi = 0. It follows that S is inconsistent. We have just shown that T has no consistent Archimedean extension, so it has only the constant model 0. A comment on the generalized semantics above: just notice that every inequality (in our sense) can be regarded as an inequality in the language of Riesz spaces (metavariables for formulas becoming variables for vectors). Keeping this in mind, the axioms of R-valued logic are true in every Riesz space and its deduction rules can be regarded as valid deduction rules in the Riesz space setting. So, if N is any Riesz space and V & N is a set of linearly independent vectors, any set T of weak inequalities satisfied in N by linear combinations of elements of Vu{0} can be viewed as a consistent theory in our sense, simply by regarding each v e V as a proposition letter. In particular, when N is linearly ordered, the set T of all inequalities satisfied in N by linear combinations of elements of V u {0}, we get a total theory. 26 Weak Completeness Theorem for Unital Theories Let T be a unital theory and let & be a unit in T. In the extended case further assume that \u00a7 is 1. Then the following are equivalent: 1. T is consistent; 16"
