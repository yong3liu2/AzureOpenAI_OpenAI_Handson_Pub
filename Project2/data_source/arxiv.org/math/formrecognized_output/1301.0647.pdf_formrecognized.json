We develop two algebraic semantics for bitten rough set theory ([19]) over similarity spaces and their abstract granular versions.

Keywords: Rough Set Theory over Tolerance Approximation Spaces, Bitten Rough Semantics, Granular Rough Semantics, A-Rough Algebras, Discernibility in Similarity Spaces 1. Introduction In classical rough set theory, information systems with equivalence relations (or approximation spaces) are studied. The data tables used have crisp symbolic values (see [16] for example). More general vari- ants with other types of relations and values have also been extensively studied in the literature (see [11], [9], [17], [13], [18] for example). The methods and concepts, including those of definability, approxima- tion, granular representability of approximations, neighbourhoods and others, need many modifications for application in these situations. We focus on similarity spaces or tolerance approximation spaces in this research paper. Tolerance approximation spaces are also of interest in representation of inexact and incomplete knowledge (see [17], [21]). In classical rough set theory, the negative region of a set is the lower approximation of the comple- ment of the set. This region is disjoint from the upper approximation of the set in question.

        "page_content": "178 A. Mani / Algebraic Semantics of Bitten Rough Sets property fails to hold in tolerance approximation spaces (TAS). To deal with this a different semantic ap- proach (to TAS) involving modified upper approximations is proposed in [19]. These modified upper approximations are formed from upper approximations by 'biting off' a part of it to form 'bitten upper approximations'. The new approximations turn out to be disjoint from the negative region of the subset and also possess better properties. More specifically, the upper approximation of a subset of a TAS formed by a set of granules (with respect to those on the subset) is reduced by the deletion of the negative region of the subset to form the 'bitten upper approximation' of the subset. This ensures that the new upper approximation is disjoint from the negative region of the subset. In the formation of approximations explicit constraints are not imposed on the possible type of granules. The authors also pose the problem of developing an algebraic semantics for the approach. In the present paper, we develop two different algebraic semantics for the same. The first of these actually captures reasoning within the power set of the set of possible order-compatible partitions of the set of roughly equivalent objects. We also prove suitable representation theorems in the third section. The main result of [2] is required in the proof of the same theorem. Between formalizing the interaction of roughly equivalent objects and formalizing the approxima- tions in a classicalist setting, we prefer the former or a dialectical version thereof ([14]). But whether this 'rough equivalence' is to be an equivalence relation or a congruence or something else, is an open question. We do not abandon the viewpoint that it should at least be an equivalence. Interestingly the known algebraic approaches (like [4]) aimed at just the approximations and derived operations in a clas- sicalist setting (as opposed to the domain of roughly equal objects) cannot be directly adapted (at least) to the present context. Given that it may not be possible to have suitable abstract representation theorems from partial al- gebras over the set of roughly equivalent objects in the context, we use choice functions in a crucial (though implicit) way to introduce simplified algebra of the bitten granular semantics SGBA. These are developed up to the level of some solvable/open problems. Here the motivation is not to integrate choice functions with rough set theory as in [15], but to build an easier semantics. At the same time the semantics is also motivated by possible connections with choice inclusive similarity based rough set theory. In the following section we mention some of the essential notions and outline the bitten approach. The first of the algebraic semantics for the bitten approach is developed in the third section. Some related problems are also posed in the same. In the fourth section, a partial algebraic semantics over a relatively easier semantic domain (with respect to the previous approach) is developed. These semantics are also applicable to particular cases of other general rough set theories including the cover based ones. This is indicated in the fifth section. 2. Background By a Tolerance Approximation Space (TAS), we mean a pair of the form S = (S, T), with S being a set and T a tolerance relation over it - these are also known as similarity or tolerance spaces. Some references for extension of classical rough set theory to TAS are [4], [10], [21], [5], [15] and [11]. These theories differ in the types of granules, process of definition of approximations, semantics and on computational aspects. We mention some important aspects of rough set theory over TAS before proceeding with the"

An approach ([11]) has been to define a new equivalence 00 on S via (x, y) E 00 if and only if domT(x) = domT(y) with domT(z) = {[x]T : z E [x]]}. This is essentially an unduly cautious 'clear perspective' approach. In [10], a theory of generalized rough sets based on covers of subsets of a given set S is considered. Let S be a set and K = {Ki} : n < o be a collection of subsets of it. We will abbreviate subsets of natural numbers of the form {1, 2, ... , n} by N(n). If X C S, then consider the sets (with Ko = \u00d8, Kn+1 = S for convenience): (i) X11 = U{Ki : Ki CX, i E {0, 1, ... , n}} (ii) X12 = UniEI(S \\Ki) : nieI(S \\ Ki) CX, I CN(n + 1)} (iii) Xu1 = NuiEIKi : X, C UiEI Ki, IN(n +1)} (iv) Xu2 = ^{S \\ Ki : X CS \\ Ki, i E {0, ... , n}} The pair (X11, xu1) is called a AU-rough set by union, while (X12, Xu2) a AI-rough set by inter- section (in the present author's notation [13]). In the notation of [10] these are (FV(X), Ft(X) and (F(X), FX(X)) respectively. We will also refer to the pair (S, K) as a AUAI-approximation system. In the TAS context, let the granules be [x] = {y; (x, y) \u20ac T} for each element x, and K be the collection of such sets. Then 11 and ul approximations of a set A should be given by (i) and (iii) above respectively. Further A1 = [{[x] ; [x] { A} = A11 and A\" = [{[x] ; [x] [ A + 0, x E A} + Au1. Note that the generalized cover approach does not prescribe any specific type of granules. In [4], the following improved approximations are defined: Al* = {x; (y) (x, y) & T, [y] { A} Au* = {x; (Vy) ((x, y) E T -> [y]T n A \u00a5 \u00d8)} Proposition 2.1. For any subset A, Al C Al* C A C AU* C AU Using this approximation, we can define a Brouwerian orthocomplementation on o(S), via A# = {x ES; (Vy \u20ac A)(x, y) & T}. These approximations and possible variants may be seen as a way of distinguishing between objects on a heuristic. The BZ and Quasi-BZ -algebraic approach ([5]) make use of a preclusivity relation P, which is defined via (a, b) E P if and only if (a, b) \u00a2 T. Semantically the derived rough operators of lower and upper approximation are generated by the preclusivity operator and the complementation relation on the power set of the approximation space or on a collection of sets under suitable constraints in a more abstract setting. For any H & S, the Brouwerian orthocomplement is H# = {x : (Vy E H) (x, y) E P}. Then the operators defined by L# (H) = Hc##c and My (H) = H## behave like lower and upper approximation operators on o(S) and are proper generalizations of the corresponding notions in the approximation space context. Semantically the BZ-algebra and variants do not capture all the possible ways of arriving at concepts of discernibility over similarity spaces. While the quasi-BZ lattice does not encompass a paradigm shift relative the BZ-algebra, the BZMV variants are designed to capture fuzzy aspects. A major problem with this approach is that the intended semantic domain is uniformly classicalist and at the object level too."

An important problem is in getting good scalable algorithms for the computation of the different types of reducts (or supersets that are close to them) (see [12, 1]). These depend on the concept of granules used. Some other notions that we will use are stated below: Definition 2.1. A double Heyting algebra L = {L, A, V, ->, 0, 0, 1} is an algebra satisfying: \u00b7 L = {L, A, V, ->, 0, 1} is a complete atomic Heyting algebra \u00b7 x \u212e x = 0; x V (x + y) = x; (x + y) V, y = x Vy \u00b7 (x V y) e z = (x + z) V (y Oz) \u00b7 z O (x / y) = (z O x) V (z O y) Definition 2.2. By a choice function x on a set S, we shall mean a function x : (S) > S, which satisfies all of the following: \u00b7 (Vx \u20ac S) x({x}) = x \u00b7 (VA E p(S) x(A) E A Definition 2.3. Let P = (P, <> be a partially ordered set and if A is any subset of P, let its lower and upper cone be L(A) = {x; (Va \u20ac A) x { a} and U(A) = {x; (Va \u20ac A) a { x} respectively. A function \u00c0 : (P) +> P will be said to be lattice-coherent with < if and only if the condition a \u2264 b then \\(L(a, b) = a) and \\(U(a, b)) = b. A-lattices were considered as a generalization of lattices in [20]. In the partially ordered set P above If \u00c0 is a lattice coherent operation, let a \u00b7 b = \\(L(a, b)) and a + b = \\(U(a, b)), then the algebra Q = (P, ., +) is said to be a A-lattice. It can be shown that if a partially ordered set has a lattice-coherent operation then it can be endowed with a A-lattice structure and conversely. Theorem 2.1. In a A-lattice Q = (P, ., +) all of the following hold: \u00b7 + is an idempotent and commutative operation \u00b7 \u00b7 is an idempotent and commutative operation \u00b7 a \u00b7 (a + b) = a \u00b7 a + (a \u00b7 b) = a \u00b7 a \u00b7 ((a \u00b7 b) \u00b7 c) = (a . b) . c \u00b7 a + ((a + b) + c) = (a + b) + c"

Mani / Algebraic Semantics of Bitten Rough Sets 181 We will use two kinds of equalities in a partial algebra (of a single sort) P = (P, f1, ... fn, v), fis being partial or total function symbols and v being an interpretation of these on the set P. Strictly speaking, the interpreted partial function should be written as f-, but we will drop the superscript for simplicity. The basic theory of partial algebras can be found in [3] for example. For two terms s and t, the strong weak equality is defined as follows: t(x) = s(x) if and only if (Vx E dom(t) = dom(s)) t(x) = s(x). In contrast, the weak equality is defined via t(x) = s(x) if and only if (Vx E dom(t) n dom(s)) t(x) = s(x). 2.1. Bitten Approach In this section we recapitulate the essential bitten proposal of [19] with some modifications. Actually the authors introduce bited upper approximations in a study on tolerance spaces. However in [21], 'bitten ap- proximations' are also considered. We will uniformly refer to these and approach by the adjective bitten. The theory apparently lays emphasis on desired mereological properties at the cost of representation. Let Gr(S) C o(S) be the collection of granules for a TAS defined by some conditions including U Gr(S) = S. A subset X is granularly definable if and only if 38 \u2103 Gr(S) X = UB. The collection of granularly definable sets shall be denoted by DefGr(S). The lower and upper approximations of X is defined via Gr\u0105(X) = U{A : A C X, A E Gr(S)} and Gr*(X) = U{A : A n X \u00a5 0, A E Gr(S)}. The positive and negative region, defined by POSGr(X) = Grx(X) and NEGGr(X) = Grx(Xc) respectively, are granularly definable. But in this scheme of things Gr*(X) n NEGGr(X) = \u00d8 is possible. To avoid this, a concept of bitten upper approximation is defined via Gr; (X) = Gr*(X) \\ NEGGr(X). Relative this the boundary is given by BNGT(X) = Gr*(X) \\ Gr\u012f(X) = S \\ (POSGr(X) U NEGGr(X)). Gr(S) may be taken to be the set of T-relateds or the set of blocks of T or something else. For exam- ple, if Gr(S) is the set of all sets of the form Tx (Tx = {y; (x, y) E T, y E S}), then S = U Gr(S) and of course Gr(S) C o(S). Given the latter two properties, the upper and lower approximations of a subset X are then given by : Gr\u012f(X) = U{Y E Gr(S); Y [ X}, Gr*(S) = U{Y E Gr(S); Yn, X \u00a5 \u00d8}. The bitten upper approximation is simply Grt (X) = Gr*(X) \\ Gr(X). If they are related to a specific tolerance, then we will call the tuple (S, Gr(S), T, Gr\u00f8, Gr\u00f8) a bitten approximation system (BAS). The properties of the approximations are as follows:"

In a TAS S, a block B C S is a maximal set that satisfies B2 C T. In [21], these are termed classes, while the former is the standard terminology in universal algebra. If HT is the collection of all blocks of T, then let AT = {nF : F C HT}. Taking this large collection as the set of granules, the authors define the the lower and bitten upper approximation of a X ( Sas X = {{A : A ( X, A \u20ac AT} and Xy = U{A : A n X = 0, A E AT} \\ (Xc)L. On the set of definable objects A(S), let \u00b7 X + Y = {{A \u20ac AT; X n A C Y} \u00b7 X OY = {B E AT; X C YUA}. Then the following theorem provides a topological algebraic semantics ([21]): Theorem 2.2. (A(S), n, U, ->, O, \u00d8, S) is a complete atomic double Heyting algebra. However extensions of the theorem to other types of granules are not known. No abstract represen- tation theorem is also proved in the particular situation. 3. Semantics for Bitten Rough Set Theory The concept of granules to be used in the theory is essentially kept open. Many types of granules may not permit nice represention theory. Despite this, our first semantics over roughly equivalent objects does well. This is due to the higher order approach used."

They are clearly deficient from the rough perspective as we do not have proper conjunction and disjunction operations. But 'biting' may actually make the partial operations total in many contexts. Proposition 3.1. ~ is an equivalence on the power set (S). Moreover the following operations and relations on p(S)| ~ are well-defined: \u00b7 L([A]) = [Gr\u012f(A)] \u00b7 - [A] = [Ac] if defined \u00b7 +([A]) = [Gr) (A)] .

For each refined abstract bitten algebra S there exists a tolerance approximation space K, such that Bite(K) = S. Proof: The proof has already been done above. The essential steps are: 1. The definition of a refined abstract bitten algebra S, ensures the existence of a related TAS P (say). 2. It can be checked that the TAS P and the TAS K (mentioned in the statement of the theorem) are isomorphic because of the representation theorem for tolerances. 3.

Discussion In the above, a semantics for the logic of roughly similar objects is developed and it has a certain rela- tionship with the original TAS. However the actual level of relationship that is desired between such a semantics, and an original generalized approximation space along with the associated process is still the subject to some judgement. This is definitely independent of logic-forming strategies like the Gentzen style algebraic ([7], [8]) or abstract algebraic approach that can be applied. Any bitten semantics with no restrictions on the type of granules can be expected to fall short of a unique representation theorem (in the sense that given the semantics, we have a specification for obtain- ing the original TAS in a unique way). We say this because in general, the process of forming approx- imations actually obscures the distribution of blocks. The latter is essential for a unique representation theorem because of [6]. When the set of granules used is the set of T-related elements, the required conditions for a unique representation theorem will necessarily include a constructive instance of the following process of for- mation of blocks from sets of T-related elements. \u00b7 Let B denote the set of all blocks of the TAS S = (S, T) and let T = {[x]T : x E, S}. \u00b7 Form the power set p(T) \u00b7 Let u(T) = {U(K) : K E p(T), TU(K) is an equivalence}. Tu(k) being the restriction of the tolerance to the set U(K). \u00b7 u(T) is partially ordered by the inclusion relation. \u00b7 Umax (T), the set of maximal elements of u(T), is the set of blocks of S. That is, umax (T) = B. 3.2. Illustrative Example Let S = {x1, x2, x3, x4} and let the tolerance T be generated on it by {(x1, x2), (x2, x3)}. Taking the granules to be the set of T-related elements, we have Gr(S) = {(x1 : x2), (x2 : X1, X3), (X3 : X2), (X4 :)}. Here (\u00d71 : \u00d72) means the granule generated by x1 is (x1, x2). The different approximations are then as in the table below. The first column in the table is for keeping track of the elements in the quotient o(S)| ~ and can be used for checking the operations of Prop. 3.1. The order structure is given by the Hasse diagram following the table. More details of the construction are omitted because the next step will take some space."

Under what general conditions will the operation of biting make the partial operation in Prop. 3.1 total? 2.

Describe the quasi equational classes (and variants) of refined abstract bitten algebras 4. Does a complete, atomic double Heyting algebra determine a unique BAS? 5. Which type of can reducts be computed with the help of these algebras? 4. Alternative Approach The appropriate semantic domain for the above semantics may be considered by some to be less natural on subjective grounds. Among these, the difficulty involved in reasoning within the power set of the set of possible order-compatible partitions of the set of roughly equivalent elements may be cited. We introduce a simpler semantics for these reasons, and also because of possible connections with the semantics for the choice inclusive similarity based rough set theory due to the present author in [15] (we consider extensions of the same in two forthcoming papers). There are many differences between the use of choice functions in [15] and in the present paper. In the former, the use of blocks as granules permit an elegant interpretation in the context of local clear discernibility and generalizations of Pawlak's theory of knowledge. This paradigm needs a complete reworking in the present context as blocks do not always relate nicely to the concept of granules used. Moreover choice is used in the definition of approximations. So we avoid doing these in the present paper and restrict ourselves to developing a semantics with less commitment to intended meaning. Choice functions are used in defining the rough operations of combining sets and extracting the common part of two sets. Definition 4.1. For any a, b E p(S)| ~, let UB(a, b) and LB(a, b) be the set of minimal upper bounds and the set of maximal lower bounds of a and b (we assume that these are nonempty for all pairs a, b). If X : 0(6(S)| ~) -> p(S)| ~ is a choice function, (by definition, it is such that (a < b > A(UB({a, b})) = b, A(LB({a, b})) = a)), then let . a + b = \u03bb (UB([a, b})) \u00b7 a \u00b7 b = \\(LB({a, b})).

Representation Problem for SGBAs Given a TAS S in a bitten rough semantic perspective, associating a single SGBA as its corresponding semantics amounts to modifying the original meaning by the introduction of artificial choice functions for the purpose of forming rough union and intersection-like operations. Either we need a justification of such preference or accept all of the possible preferences. So the default semantics must be given by a set of SGBAs indexed by the set of all possible choice functions in the lambda lattice formation context. In this perspective the semantics can be explained directly and a sequent calculus associated (and with little additional representation theory). Let x E S, then ([x]T)} = [x]T, while ([x]T)u = ([x]T)\\ \\ (S \\ [x]T)'). It is obvious that elements with nonempty lower approximation that are minimal with respect to the rough order will be equivalent to elements of this type. Once the order relation on the set of roughly equivalent elements has been deduced, then we can find the elements of this type. This permits the reconstruction of the equivalence based partition of the power set of S. If we do not know all the choice functions involved, then it is not possible in general to determine or construct the blocks of the tolerance T. But when will a knowledge of given subsets of choice functions permit us to determine the blocks of T? This is the problem of representation of SGBAs. It is also significant in a more general algebraic setting."

Connections with AUAI Approximation Systems In a AUAI approximation system (S, K), the collection K need not be the most appropriate concept of granule for the four different approximations of the theory (this is considered in detail in a forthcoming paper by the present author). The implicit conditions on the possible concepts of a granule in the bitten approach are the following: \u00b7 The set of granules S is a partition of S, that is US = S. \u00b7 The form of the lower and bitten upper approximation are given as in the subsection on 'Bitten Approach' Theorem 5.1. Given a BAS (S, Gr(S), T, Gr*, Grt), the AUAI approximation system (S, Gr(S)) sat- isfies 1. (VX E p(S) X11 = Grx(X) 2. (VX E p(S) Xu1 ( Gr*(X) 3. (VX \u20ac p(S) Grt(X) = Gr*(X) n Xu2 Proof: 1. XU = U{A : A C X; A E Gr(S)} = Gr(X) 2. Xul is the intersection of all unions of elements of Gr(S), while Gr*(X) is the union of all elements of Gr(S) that have non empty intersection with X. In general if Gr(S) is a collection of pairwise disjoint sets then Xul = Gr*(X), else Xul C Gr*(X). 3. Gr.(X) = Gr*(X) \\ Grx(X) = Gr*(X) n (Gr*(X)c. But NAS : X ( Aq; A\u00a1 E Gr(S)} = NAC : X\u00ba C Ai E Gr(S)} = (U{Ai : X\u00ba C Ai})C = (Grx(Xc))c = Xu2. So Grt (X) = Gr*(X) n Xu2 holds. In the above theorem, we have taken the collection K of the AUAI approximation system (S, K) to coincide with Gr(S). This need not be the case in general and many variations are possible on the point. In particular we can select the collection K so that Gr (X) coincides with Xu2. 6. Concluding Remarks In this research paper, we have developed two different algebraic semantics of bitten rough set theory. Topology is involved in a explicit way in the first of two. In the bitten approach, some types of granules can hinder possible seamless representation theorems, while others may be more useful. So the theory is not independent of the type of granules in entirety. The associated logics can be expected to have high expressive power due to the higher order approach used."

        "page_content": "A. Mani / Algebraic Semantics of Bitten Rough Sets 197 A positive solution for the first problem would mean a much simpler algebraic semantics provided we can fix the notion of logical consequence in a suitable way. But even in those cases the first semantics would remain relevant. The nature of the semantic domain used and therefore the effective object level in the first approach is very different and amounts to a new paradigm in rough set theory. In the second approach, though the semantic domain is natural, it is not a fully explored one in the context of rough sets ([15]). If we use different types of semantic domain at the object level, then some natural relative distortions may creep in. From the technical point of view this may or may not affect actual applications. A deeper study of such distortions will be considered in future work. The second approach can be accordant with different interpretations of choice and therefore is a more open ended semantics. Application of this type of semantics requires a more conscious and regulated way of forming approximations or 'specifying the indiscernibles'. The algebraization strategy developed is relevant for other types of generalized rough set theory. These include generalized cover and pure granule based approaches. For these reasons, we will consider these connections and sequent calculi for the algebraic semantics in a separate paper.
