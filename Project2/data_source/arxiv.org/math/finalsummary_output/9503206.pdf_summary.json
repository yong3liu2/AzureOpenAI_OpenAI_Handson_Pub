        "Summary": ". The contents discuss the construction of a model for a consistent formal theory using the method of extension to a complete Henkin Theory. This involves defining the Fnl1 signature as the basic structure of a 1st order functional logic language and specifying a standardized language to determine the notion of an expression. The definition of a Fnl1 structure and the semantics for the language are derived from the notion of structure based on a signature. This includes the introduction of new features such as the division of expressions into sentences and individuals, and the weakening of the classification of symbolic entities into logical connectives, predicate symbols, and function symbols. The logical axioms and rules for the calculus of Functional Logic are also discussed, as well as the extension of this calculus by individual nonlogical axioms to form a functional logic theory. The concept of overloading symbols is introduced as a way to simplify axiom-schemes, but it requires a change from the notion of symbol to that of symbolic entity. The standardized form is used as a basis for meta-linguistic reference, and non-standardized usages are retained. The main problem is introducing appropriate semantics for the calculus to be complete, and a solution is proposed by restricting the argument ranges of the interpretation-structure. This involves extending the notion of structure to include a new component that assigns a selected set to each sequence of sorts. The contents also discuss the use of standardized symbolization and the distinction between standardized and non-standardized expressions. Examples are given to illustrate the use of symbolic entities and standardized expressions in functional logic, including the representation of primitive recursive functions and the use of quantifiers to variables of different sorts. The importance of simplicity in the standardized language for practical application is also emphasized."
