        "Summary": "The article explores the relationship between multidimensional persistence and natural homology in the context of posets. It discusses the main result, Theorem 3, which states that the natural homology of a pospace can be obtained from uni-dimensional persistence modules along traces. The article also discusses extensions of this result, including the use of metric structures and algorithmic considerations. It provides an example of a matchbox to illustrate the construction, where the trace space is shown to have the structure of a topological space and can be represented as a simplicial set. The article also discusses the use of colimit constructions to \"glue\" together the unidimensional persistence modules obtained along traces in order to recover the entire natural homology diagram of a given pospace. It also explores the relationship between natural homology and persistent homology, and how the shift in perspective can provide more tractable ways of computing natural homology and give succinct descriptions of the semantics of concurrent and distributed systems. The article also presents Proposition 1, which states that in the case of a partially ordered space, there exists an order relation on traces that is isomorphic to the factorisation category of the space. It also discusses the classification problem of directed spaces and the use of natural homology as a topological invariant to determine when two directed spaces are dihomeomorphic. The article concludes by suggesting further links and avenues of future work in this direction."
