Assignment #3:

    get the content with the highest socre and then feed back into prompt to construct final user content.
2.3.1_DataPreparationEmbedding.ipynb - data preparation using embedding, then save results in .csv files.
2.3.2_ChatBotUsingOwnDataViaAiSearch.ipynb - this is another approach leverage Azure AI search,
